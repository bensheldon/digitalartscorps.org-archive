On Friday, September 22, CUWiN will join other community network organizations around the world in celebration and education.  CUWiN will be hosting an open house were people can become familar us, what we do, and community wireless network.  We will also be designating part of our office space and allowing the use of our LAN for gaming (BYOG -- Bring Your Own Games).  The organizers of One Web Day are encouraging people to document their celebration by uploading photos from the day the Flickr, and tagging them with onewebday.</p>
<p>While not part of the day&#39;s activities, CUWiN will be hosting its monthly &quot;Hack Night&quot; on Sunday.  This hack night&#39;s focus will be a community wireless forum, and will serve as an oppurtunity to further educate the community on community wireless networks, as well as gain input from the community as to the direction they would like to see the project take. </p>

<p>    Well, last night I was up loading  the pics I took at the PSO. About half way through it told me that I had uploaded 100% of allowed photo&#39;s for this month. So, you can&#39;t see all of them yet. But check them out any way.  Here&#39;s a link. I tried to make it clickable with some code, but I guess it wasn&#39;t Allowed code. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/73526260@N00/sets/72157594290147778/" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/73526260@N00/sets/72157594290147778/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/73526260@N00/sets/72157594290147778/</a></p>
<p>Help me out, if you will. I&#39;ve forgotten some people&#39;s names. (sorry!!) so if you are looking and see that I&#39;ve put a &#39;?&#39; then let me know the name and I change it straight away. -Thanks, R.</p>
<p>    Also check out this: <a href="http://blip.tv/file/75849" title="http://blip.tv/file/75849">http://blip.tv/file/75849</a> it&#39;s a video that I took while a few of us were at the Hub Pub. While you are there you can check out three of the shorts I made while in college. :D</p>
<p>    Things are going well. emailed a bunch of area principals today about surveying the students to see what type of programing they&#39;d like to use at the Community Media Center. Hopefully we&#39;ll be allowed to go into some classes and find out what the kids want. Then if we are lucky we&#39;ll be able to get a budget for such things. Money. vs. Monet. lol.</p>
<p>        That&#39;s if for now.</p>
<p>Ta ta,</p>

	    <p>i meant to post about something i discovered but i forgot...if you resize the pictures before uploading them it greatly reduces the amount of your monthly bandwidth they take (like more than it seems like it should). the largest size people can see them is with the larger side at 1024pixels so you might as well shrink your photos to that.</p>

	    <p>Also, the flickr uploader software will resize photos automatically as you upload them (so they take up less of your upload bandwidth, like Cheryl said). It&#39;s available from <a href="http://flickr.com/tools/">flickr&#39;s tools section</a>.</p>

				<p>Well, it seems most people have been at their postions for at least a week.  I just started today.  I&#39;m working for <a href="http://digitalartscorps.org/www.aspirationtech.org">Aspiration</a> in downtown San Francisco, which is incredibly cool.  I got a nice computer and a nice workspace.  This morning Heather (my supervisor) went through all the tools I&#39;ll be using, and I&#39;m looking forward to getting my hands on them.  Gunner (my other supervisor) took everyone at Aspiration out to lunch (that&#39;s easy when there&#39;s only 3 people).  Right now they&#39;re at a meeting, and I&#39;ve been playing around with my computer and the <a href="http://digitalartscorps.org/socialsourcecommons.org">Social Source Commons</a> (which Gunner will show me more about when he gets back).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week I spent moving.  First driving down to South Carolina where I gave my parents my car, and then flying to Oakland on Tuesday.  My furniture all arrived on Thursday, and my wife and I were completely unpacked and organized by Sunday (more or less).  We actually invited a few people over for a movie Sunday night as inspiration to us to get everything done. </p>

				<p>So, I officially started work at the <a href="http://digitalartscorps.org/www.storycenter.org" target="_blank">Center for Digital Storytelling</a> about a week ago. So far so good, except that I&#39;m definitely experiencing some of what we talked about at the PSO as far as trying to figure out where I fit in at the organization. This is the first year that CDS has had a VISTA, and though there seems to be a lot going on here, I&#39;m still not sure exactly how I&#39;ll be involved in all of it. Well, no reason to panic yet, I&#39;m sure things will fall into place as time goes on.</p>
<p> The good news is that the center hosted an open workshop last week. Open workshops are where community members can sign up to come do a three day workshop to learn how to do digital storytelling. The goal of the three days is for every participant to produce a digital story. The workshop begins with a story/script writing circle and ends three days later with a screening of everyone&#39;s finished work. It&#39;s an intense process but very rewarding. I had the chance to particpate in the workshop, allowing me to see how they work from a partcipant&#39;s perspective as the first step in my training as a workshop facilitator. Yay! I love making digital stories, so I can&#39;t complain about spending half of my first week at work making one. </p>
<p>In other news, the housing search continues. It&#39;s not easy to find housing in Berkeley on a VISTA stipend, but it is possible. I&#39;ve seen a few apartments so far and hopefully will find the right place soon. </p>
<p> Hmmm...guess that&#39;s all for now. I trust everything is going well for the rest of y&#39;all! Hopefully in the near future I will start a blip.tv account and post the digital story I made in the workshop.  </p>

				<p>I just read an interesting <a href="http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2006/09/is_a_computer_l.html">article</a> about a dichotomy in computer usage:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bicycle:</strong> The computer amplifies your own capacities or abilities</li>
<li><strong>Car:</strong> The computer comes with pre-packaged formulas or solutions whose inner workings you don't have to understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>The article discusses this in the context of presentations--it is  the <a href="http://digitalartscorps.org/presentationzen.blogs.com">Presentation Zen Blog</a>, of course.  For example, students can be taught PowerPoint in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is how you make a slide. This is how you make a transition.  Put a picture in by clicking this button.  Use this drop-down menu to start the show. As a <em>car</em>.  Or...
</li><li>This is how you tell a story.  These are good methods for displaying data.  This is how to edit effectively.  As a <em>bicycle</em>
</li></ul>
<p>And of course there is lot's of good advice on the blog on how to make a good presentation.</p>

				<p>Hello to all! I hope that you are all having fun as a VISTA and that your first week of work has been okay. </p>
<p>All is well here in Tennessee. I have been busy working and learning how to do my &quot;job&quot;. So far, I have rewritten the &quot;Volunteer Handbook&quot; and &quot;Volunteer Application&quot; for the STAR Center. I have also been able to talk to several people who are interested in volunteering and have scheduled for them to come in for training. In the next week, I will be busy doing trainings, orientation, and tours of the STAR Center. </p>
<p>I have also been doing some research for a new adult literacy lab that will be opening (officially) at the end of October. I will need to find several volunteers to run this lab as well. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if any of you are interested in adult literacy resources, but if you are, I have found some cool websites:   <a href="http://literacyconnections.com" title="Literacy Connection">http://literacyconnections.com/AdultLiteracy.php</a> and <a href="http://literacyonline.org" title="Literacy Online">http://literacyonline.org</a>. The first one features several different links, one of which is a newspaper written specifically for new readers.  </p>

				<p>Since living cheaply is a concern for us, I thought I would share this resource that was shared with me.  Since there appear to be a few of you that, for many different reasons, don&#39;t qualify for food stamps, there is a group called <a href="http://www.angelfoodministries.com/" title="Angel Food Ministries">Angel Food Ministries</a> that has no income verification and anyone can purchase their boxes of food.  If you read the About Us page, it tells how they got started and what the boxes of groceries typically contain.  </p>
<p> It looks as though there are locations all over the U.S. so take a look and see if there is something in your area.  The menu is posted for October and changes every month.  The only catch is that you have to pay for your groceries approximately 2 weeks before you can pick them up, but for $25, who cares about the wait!!  There are add on packs for $18 each month that change as well.  </p>
<p>For those of you that do receive food stamps, they accept those as well, so you can get more bang for your food stamp buck. </p>

</p><p>What I would like to do now is come up with a good way for everybody to:</p>
<p>a) update and distribute the vCard files (when changes are made to their info), and</p>
<p>b) distribute thumbnail headshots of everybody (to attach to their info cards), for that those of us who are terrible at remembering names. </p>
<p>Maybe this is something that nobody else is interested in, but I would very much like to have up-to-date contact cards, and little pictures, of all of the CTC VISTAs. So if any of y&#39;alls have suggestions, or better ideas, let me know. </p>

	    <p>maybe you could include screennames too?</p>
<p>i am not sure if we can include files on blog entries, but if we could and we could make posts that were visible only to logged in people then you could just put it up here. big ifs though.</p>
<p>so maybe... well, we could set up a livejournal or similar account that everyone would have the username and password for and put the contact info there in a locked entry. again files can&#39;t be stored there, but maybe we could just have an old fashioned list instead? although pictures would be nice. we could store the pictures elsewhere and not name them meaningfully and just link to them from the entry. </p>
<p>it seems like most of our contact info won&#39;t be changing too much (at least over the year) so we could just have one person in charge of the contact info and anyone who wanted to change stuff could contact that person. but if we went with the livejournal-type-thing idea anyone could just log in and change their own info. </p>

	    <p>i was under the impression that checking the &quot;make private&quot; option would make the contact info unavailable to anyone not at project headquarters. but that does not seem to be the case (for example tim chose make private but i can still see his profile: <a href="http://ctcvista.org/user/978" title="http://ctcvista.org/user/978">http://ctcvista.org/user/978</a>  ). that means it is possible for us to share contact info with only the vistas through this site -- i didn&#39;t realize that before. but i think there should be 3 options for profile privacy levels - public (anyone can see), protected (anyone logged in can see), and private (only those who need to see can).</p>

	    <p>Whatever&#39;s cool with me.  I was just looking for a way to get everybody&#39;s name and e-mail together with a picture of them, so that I can remember who is who.  I don&#39;t know about everybody else, but I find that I communicate better when I know what the person looks like who I am communicating with.  </p>
<p>Becauses when there is a picture next to somebody&#39;s contact info, I feel like I am communicating with a real person, and not just some mysterious faceless cyber-entity.</p>
<p> The moral of my story: Pictures of ourselves in the contacts section would be awesome.  Especially if  they are only accessible to those who are logged in.  </p>

	    <p>Just an idea to throw out there --  </p>
<p>I know there is a spreadsheet feature on gmail that looks almost like excel and can be shared.   That could take care of sharing our info in one online sheet and also can be set to editable by any of us.   Also, gmail has a chat feature where you can upload a picture and use that as an icon.  The chatting feature can also maybe lead to an online meeting place?   And one more thing about gmail (sorry, I really like gmail), there is a calendar feature that we can add events and birthdays and anything else.   </p>
<p>This option though would require anyone without a gmail account, to add yet another email account to the ever-growing email addresses we all have.  I&#39;ve got 100 invites if anyone is interested in a gmail account, regardless.</p>

				<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Hope everyone&#39;s first week is going well! I was hoping to get some ideas and suggestions from those of you who have any knowledge about what I guess I am calling access control. This is an area that I am unfamiliar with and trying to utilize all of my resources to learn more about:) </p>
<p>We would like to find some software for our computer center that will allow us to:</p>
<p>-require users to login and logout</p>
<p>-track who logs in and when</p>
<p>-prevents users from accessing certain controls and settings </p>
<p>-and return the computer to its original settings (so that nothing is permanently saved) upon logout </p>
<p>I have found a few programs that might accomplish this (Public Access Desktop, WinU, and Clean Slate), but I wanted to see if anyone had any expertise in this area. I would appreciate any comments or suggestions that you may have.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Andrea</p>

	    <p>...i will take a shot at this since no one else has yet even though i am far from an expert on this. i assume your computers are running windows.</p>
<p>as for requiring users to login and logout, you could just make the only account on each computer have a password and then share that account info with your users. unfortunately that will not allow you to track who is logging in. </p>
<p>the only decent way i can think of to track who logs in involves giving everyone their own usernames so that you can tell who has logged on by the username. if you want each user to be able to use any computer, you will need to set up a server computer which will store the account info (and it could keep records of users logging in and out - see <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/kwsupport/archive/2005/02/24/36942.aspx" title="http://msmvps.com/blogs/kwsupport/archive/2005/02/24/36942.aspx">http://msmvps.com/blogs/kwsupport/archive/2005/02/24/36942.aspx</a> ) and then when a user tries to login to a computer their request will go through the server. (unless you only have a few users and can manually make each of them an account on each computer they might use. or unless you decide to assign users to particular computers. and in those cases i am not sure how user logon/offs could be tracked but i bet there is a way.)</p>
<p>to prevent users from accessing certain controls and settings you could make the accounts they use non-administrator accounts. that may or may not be enough control for you. if not, there are software programs that can be used to block access to certain things but i only know about them from having used computers with these programs on them.</p>
<p>if you have separate user accounts on a server, one way to return the computers to their original settings is to have logoff scripts that erase files, undo changes etc. or you could use the server to reset their profile to a clean one at each login. </p>
<p>good luck and let us know how this goes.</p>

	    <p>Hi Andrea,</p>
<p>I too am useless in this area, but deep in my consciousness comes out the term &quot;<span class="text">workstation protection management&quot; and the</span> software <a href="http://www.faronics.com/html/deepfreeze.asp" target="_blank">Deep Freeze</a>, which might do what you need.  </p>
<p>Also, this sounds like a very tech assistance to np question, so maybe hit up <a href="user/807.html" target="_blank">Aliya</a>, VISTA leader for that priority area.  </p>
<p>Also, check out Tech Soup, especially the <a href="http://www.techsoup.org/learningcenter/networks/index.cfm" target="_blank">Network section</a> or this article &quot;<a href="http://www.techsoup.org/learningcenter/techplan/page4892.cfm" target="_blank">Securing Public Access PCs Without Shutting Out Users</a>&quot;</p>

	    <p>I think Cheryl summed it up pretty well: usernames and passwords.</p>
<p>Are your workstations Windows-based? Mac-based? Linux-based? A mixture?  Setting up usernames and passwords is slightly different with each.  I&#39;m guessing that you&#39;d like a particular user to be able to log into any workstation she chooses with the same username and password.  This requires a centralized username/password database.</p>
<p>In the Windows world, this means having one machine act as a primary domain controller.  You can do this with WIndows 2000 server, Windows 2003 server, or a Linux-based Samba server.  You configure all workstations to grab their username/password info from the server.  All logins and logouts are monitored by the server, and should give you all the information you could ever want (username, IP address, WINS/DNS address, times, etc.).</p>
<p>Unix machines (Macs included) use a different sort of password database, but they can still be configured to get information from a Windows server.</p>
<p>As far as access control to various programs, Cheryl&#39;s again right about &quot;administrator&quot; access.  Actually, Windows 2000 and newer have several groups to which you can add users.  They&#39;re called:</p>
<p>System Operators, Replicators, Guests, Power Users, Print Operators, Administrators, Account Operators, Backup Operators, Users.</p>
<p>You can add usernames to each of these groups (to more than one group, even), and that will give them basic permissions.  You&#39;ll probably want to keep things simple and mainly use the Administrators and Users groups.  Everyone in the Administrators group will have full power over all systems.</p>
<p> As far as access control to different programs, I&#39;m no expert, but I assume that this can be done.</p>
<p>As far as saving files, you&#39;ll need to decide how much control you&#39;re willing to give people.  Will they get a &quot;My Documents&quot; folder?  Will saved files stick around after logout?  Should people be confined only to a USB thumb drive or CD drive?  You most likely do not want to allow people to execute files from these sources, though.   If you can quickly restore a computer, this may not be such an issue for you.  Logout scripts can be of service in restoring settings.</p>
<p>Accessing the Internet: What services do you want to allow?  What is your privacy policy going to be?  Do you monitor network traffic?  Do your workstations have public IP addresses, or do you use Network Address Translation (NAT) and private IP numbers?  A proxy server would be a good way to monitor network traffic, but it brings along the headaches of having to configure web browsers, e-mail clients, IM clients, etc.  If you&#39;re using NAT, and your server logs diligently, you&#39;ll know at what time a given computer is accessing a given service (website, IM, e-mail, etc.). </p>
<p>Good luck and let us know how it&#39;s going!</p>

				<p>Hey everyone- </p>
<p>Hope the first week is going well.  Mine&#39;s swell.  I even have a workspace and in the future, a file cabinet.  exciting.</p>
<p>Anyways...</p>
<p> I&#39;m at Media Bridges and my job this year is to start and build the MB Youth Channel.  The first stage is to look for programming made by youth.  And since we don&#39;t really have that yet, I&#39;m hoping that other orginzations (digital storytelling included) may have some videos they are willing to share for public access.   Credit, of course, will be given to the producers and the distrubters.  </p>
<p>So any one out there who has videos, made by youth (25 and under), and is happy to play it on Cincinnati Local Cable Access, would be much appreciated.  Once we get our program going, maybe we can exhange???  </p>
<p>email me if interested.</p>
<p> thanks </p>

<p> I worked with a youth documentary camp over the summmer, which produced 7 short documentaries.  The program I am with now also produces youth documentaries, but I haven&#39;t watched them yet.  If you are interested in showing this kind of stuff, let me know, and I&#39;ll ask around to see if it&#39;s okay for you to use.</p>

	    <p>Hey Lauren,</p>
<p>You&#39;re looking for content for your station to show on the air, made by youth?  You should get hooked into this new digital distribution network that Andrew from the <a href="http://www.youthchannel.org/index.html" target="_blank" title="MNN">MNN Youth Channel</a> is trying to create where public access stations could exchange content.  He might have some handy immediately to share with you on DVD too.  Send him an email and let him know I sent ya.  </p>
<p>Also, check out <a href="http://digitalbicycle.org/" target="_blank" title="Digital Bicycle">Digital Bicycle</a>, a digital distribution project for community media centers in development. </p>
<p>Also, if any of you who commented could put up an examples on Blip.tv and tag it &quot;<a href="http://blip.tv/posts/?topic_name=ctcvista&amp;topic=37319" target="_blank">ctcvista</a>&quot;, it could show up on the CTC VISTA site as well.</p>

				<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I hope everyone had a safe trip back and is enjoying their work thus far.  I just wanted to drop a quick-line to let all of you know about this awesome web-site and list-serve, called Young Non-profit Professionals Network.  The link below will take you to a local area network for Chicago, Boston and NYC among others.  If there is not a list-serve in your area, they give you the tools to start one.</p>

I know they don&#39;t want this to get too much like myspace, but it would be convienant to be able to communicate one on one with each other on this site.

				<p>    Well it&#39;s day two and I thought I&#39;d better get around to doing a blog before Danielle comes to Grand Rapids to kick my butt.  :D</p>
<p>    I&#39;ve basically been on the job for two weeks already. The Grand Rapids Community Media Center hired me as a contract worker for two weeks so I could get a head start. Get some training in before the school year started so I wouldn&#39;t be jumping in cold with students. </p>
<p>    I&#39;m working mostly with an organization within the GRCMC called MoLLIE, short for Mobile Learning Lab for Information Education. One of the things we do is go into a few of the Grand Rapids Public Schools and teach students to make short videos based on something they are learning in class. Today we were at a special school here called Zoo School. It&#39;s for bright 6th graders and is a small school run at the John Ball Park Zoo.</p>
<p>    Even though my ex-girlfriend of 4 years had three kids and I&#39;ve been a substitute teacher for the past 2 years, I was still nervous about going into the class today. But I didn&#39;t need to be. I worked with a great group of kids. That won&#39;t always be the case, I imagine, but it was agood way to start. </p>
<p>    So, altogether five of us went in to a class of 30 armed with video cameras, tripods, and microphones. We split into groups of six. Each group had three pairs that were working on a report for a particular animal. So all the students took turns behind and in front of the camera.</p>
<p>    On Thursday we do the same with a second group at the school. Then on Thursday we bring in the iBooks with their footage on them and they edit. There won&#39;t be a lot of editing to do this time around. We kept it very simple as we only have two hours per session with them.    </p>
<p>    Another thing I did today was work on surveys. We want to find out what kind of services our Community is interested in. So we made three surveys. One to take to the schools, one for non profit organizations that work with kids, and one for the general community. </p>
<p>    These surveys will hopefully give us an idea of what type of new programming I can help the GRCMC and MoLLIE develope. I&#39;m very excited to get that going. </p>
<p>    Well, I think I&#39;m running a bit long. So, I&#39;ll stop here.</p>
<p>Peace,</p>
<p>Richard.</p>
<p>P.S. I love that I can indent my paragraphs. </p>

				<p>i really hope we all keep up with our blogs, because <strong>i want to be able to keep up with all of you!</strong> ok, now for some &quot;vista life&quot; type stuff i&#39;ve been thinking about / looking into:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>   *** food stamps ***</p>
<p>  according to stuff online, i don&#39;t think i am eligible for food stamps since i have too much savings (too much being more than the limit of $2,000). savings in an ira must be included toward this limit, even though according to wikipedia &quot;a debtor in bankruptcy can exempt his or her IRA from the bankruptcy estate&quot; and this seems like it should be a similar situation.</p>
<p>  also, higher rent payments (after a certain amount that it is assumed you can pay) leads to being eligible for a higher amount of food stamps. this makes sense in a way -- after all, sometimes (depending on where one&#39;s job is) one can&#39;t help but get an expensive apartment. but on the other hand, sometimes one can choose between more expensive apartments that are bigger/more convenient/newer and less expensive apartments that aren&#39;t. it seems that one shouldn&#39;t get more food stamps just because one&#39;s rent is higher -- it should depend on other factors such as the average apartment rent in the area.</p>
<p>  anyway, though it would have been nice to be able to get better/more food, i am glad i am not eligible for food stamps because i think if i were it would be hard for me to not get them. and i am not sure i think getting food stamps is the moral thing for me to do since i can live decently without them. actually, this is a question i struggle with a lot: <strong>how much unnecessary stuff must one have/buy before it is wrong? what do you guys think?</strong></p>

<p>   *** health <em>benefits</em> ***</p>
<p>  does anyone else think it is strange that we won&#39;t get our health benefit cards for a while (what was it, 4-6 weeks)? i think we should at least get our member numbers and stuff like that right away.</p>
<p>  i was looking through the guide to the health plan, and some of the stuff was kinda weird. there are a number of treatments that are not covered by the plan even if they were not preexisting, such as narcolepsy and add and aids medicines. i don&#39;t expect these omissions to be a problem for me personally, but <strong>i wonder how they decide things like that</strong>.</p>
<p>  one of the &quot;exclusions to covered services&quot; is &quot;Any services related to the treatment of allergies including allergy tests and surveys, injection, medication and treatment (except for emergency treatment including medication and hospitalization for asthma)&quot;. so recently i&#39;ve been having this itching in my ears that i think is caused by allergies but for all i know it could actually be caused by some weird ear disease. if i go to the doctor and then they decide it is caused by allergies, will the health plan not cover the doctor visit even though i didn&#39;t know it was allergies at first?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>   *** cheap stuff ***</p>
<p>  for getting things cheaply or even for free, check out the websites <strong>craigslist and freecycle</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>   you guys are <strong>great</strong> and i hope you have great first days.</p>

	    <p>Wow, &quot;<strong>how much unnecessary stuff must one have/buy before it is wrong?</strong>,&quot; that&#39;s a deep philosophical question. I&#39;m not sure how to answer that. Who decides what is unnecessary? Are things that are unnecessary for one necessary for another? Or is there a hard and fast rule? </p>
<p>Technically all one &#39;needs&#39; is shelter, food, and water. But I believe <strong>everyone</strong>&#39;s lives should be richer than merely having those needs met. Though I don&#39;t believe <strong>anyone</strong> deserves to live in mansions, have five cars, and gold plated socks. But I have a lot of unnecessary souvenirs that I&#39;d be quite upset if someone decided that I wasn&#39;t allowed to keep them.</p>
<p>It&#39;s an interesting debate.</p>
<p>I&#39;d also like to say that I agree that there are a lot of <em>strange </em>things about our &quot;health benefits&quot; plan. Preventative care is so much smarter and saves much more money in the long run. Like so many businesses these days, the people that decided on this are not looking beyond the short term. Short sightedness has a strangle hold on our society just as much as material possessions do.</p>
<p>But I got the impression that we shouldn&#39;t complain too much. At least not til the end of our service.  ;D</p>
<p>Peace </p>

	    <p>Hey Cheryl, </p>
<p>I was thinking about your question about the moralism of food stamps and in case you wanted them, these are my thoughts: I think you should do it, because....</p>
<p>1-  you are on a budget and could be making a lot more money for the work that you are doing, so there is no reason you should feel bad about it.</p>
<p>2- By you receiving food stamps, others who need them are not hindered from getting them, so you are not taking anyone&#39;s means of eating away. You are merely costing the gov&#39;t a little more money which brings me to #3...</p>
<p>3- The gov&#39;t is taxing us on our stipend (and our education award at the end, pshaw!) so just consider it taxing them back :)</p>
