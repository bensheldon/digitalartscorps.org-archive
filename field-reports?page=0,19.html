				<p>This is my fourth week at the Diskovery Center in Little Tokyo.  I have been setting up meetings to meet with the Lanterman Regional Center for a Introduction to Inclusion training/discussion on ways to improve our center to be more accessible for the disable.  Hopefully i'll get to learn more ways to make the center better.  I have been doing a lot of research on what I can do and thinking up questions to ask our training instructor.  I have tried out some software that we have here at the diskovery center and download demos.  Some of the software are not easy to use, even for me.  I attended a class that the diskovery center here offers and tried using a trackball with the lessons given, it was not easy to use.  I will have to learn ways to improve the lessons taught here to be inclusive for the disabled.<br />
         I have also set up a meeting for Asstive Technology training.  We have to decide what type of software/hardware we are going to buy for our center with the budget we have.  The training to use the software/hardware will be held after we buy the materials.  Hopefully i'll know what to get and make our centers better for the disabled.</p>

				<p>So after the flight home to Florida from the <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/dejitarob/AmeriCorpsCTCVISTAOrientation">PSO</a>, I made it to <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/dejitarob/GainesvilleToPortland">Portland in 4 days</a>. We found a house on the outskirts of the city and were able to get our place furnished all with free stuff from <a href="http://www.craigslist.com/">craigslist </a>and <a href="http://freecycle.org/">freecycle </a>:D (still looking for a table though). We even found some free tomato plants and some other pre-started veggies for 50 cents each.</p>
<p>Portland seems pretty cool; I think it's different than Florida yet similar at the same time. I like the fact that there are a ton of parks, local business, co-ops, collectives, biking and gardening stuff. The city itself is comprised of distinct yet compacted and connected neighborhoods so suburban sprawl has been kept to a minimal level.</p>
<p>But I was expecting there to be more trees in the city (there are zero downtown and not much old growth in the residential areas) and really surprised to find out that there is a lot of heavily polluting industry here. The port is actually a Superfund site, meaning the government is funding the cleanup of toxic waste since the original responsible corporations are no longer around (the actual people might still be, but ridiculously, corporations are defined like people under US law so they usually get off scot free when the business goes under or is sold, etc).</p>
<p>Besides the <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/dejitarob/Portland">view</a> from NTEN's office (as long as you don't look at the port), I like the fact that my supervisor is really nice and seems to be way more open and respectful than other supervisor's I have had (especially in grad school). However, I have been doing nothing but data-entry and administrative stuff since I arrived. Although I certainly don't mind some if it helps others, my wrist was sore from all the repetition. It helped a little bit when I located a <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com">decent macro application</a> to slightly automate the transfer of thousands of member entries between two different databases we are using for "constituency relationship management" (CRM). Yes, this is only one of the many buzzwords I have learned over the past few weeks. Personally, I am not a big fan of wannabe catchy pop phrases. But I'll have to save that for another post :).</p>
<p>Fortunately, it looks like I will be moving on to doing less data-entry. I will be posting weekly round ups of interesting discussion on NTEN's <a href="http://groups.nten.org/">Affinity Groups</a> (fancy mailing lists that are user-driven, i.e. anyone can create one). I also will be developing materials for assisting moderators of the groups. To get practical experience, I created my own group about <a href="http://groups.nten.org/group.htm?mode=home&amp;message=group_privacy_settings_saved&amp;igid=58253">free/open-source software and Linux</a>. Hopefully, the trend of less data-entry will continue as I become more familiar with the organization. </p>
<p>Btw, I highly recommend you check out <a href="http://nten.org">NTEN's website</a> if you have not already. There is a ton of information and lots of <a href="http://groups.nten.org/grouplist.htm">different groups</a> in the Affinity Groups platform that might be a good resource for a wide range of things.</p>

	    <p>I'm wondering what's up with catchy pop phrases too.  Though I did laugh when someone asked at a conference last year if there was  a site where they could go to "download Web 2.0" - They were earnest though, yet I'm laughing?   How do you reconcile the 'digital knowledge affluence' you swim in with the disparities of the world?  How can your efforts as a knowledgeable, fresh out of college VISTA support others?  Explore what tricks exist.</p>

				<p>We have been very active acessing our infrastucture and looking at electronic "edge" solutions to connect the 47 Acre former jail site. Coax cable litterally runs everywhere. As a former jail site, cameras were posted on poles with Coax and power. What a great way to light it up with Wifi ! Open access to this would be good.</p>
<p>I have been talking with AT&amp;T about T1 lines. Two campuses are physical seperated by about 3 miles. Unfortunately, there is no line of site short of repeating off a mountain, and tower space up there is maxed out. We can leverage the Teleconnect fund and got our requests in very early for this year. I should have a solid quotation on Monday July 16.</p>
<p>The community access computer lab is taking great shape. Enough very nice, alike computer tables were donated to us by Gruman Aero - Space. We ahe some very interesting tapped in senior voluteers. One is a Physist another an electronics engineer. I really having fun with them.</p>
<p>The lab is connected to our "core" with a 12 strand fiber! Air conditioning and dedicated power branches go into the double wide mobile. How cool is that?</p>
<p>I have been "collecting" volunteers that fit our senior Digital Story Telling mission. Thus far I have on board a very talented photographer (Adobe Photoshop), a grad student that knows Dreamweaver and Java Script, the next move is to approach the local cable company for video...things are happening!</p>
<p>I will be manning our other campus lab next week to observe how it is being utilized. We have (6) dells on the Inet there. It is a "walk in center".</p>
<p>Sorry for the delayed report. I have been posting to the site but forgot about the report area! Jim</p>

				<p>So we've been working on a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities for a digitization project in cooperation with the Spokane library's Northwest Room (which houses local history). Its enough to make your head spin. Our deadline is tuesday so its crunch time.</p>
<p>In the mentime I've been working on a current project to go to small museums in our area to help them digitize their collections which is funded by a grat from Humanities Washington.</p>
<p>I'm getting a real crash course in the world of grant writing, and am just trying to hold my own.<br />
Next project another grant from NEH for a teacher's workshop. </p>
<p>Keep your fingers crossed for grants :-)</p>

	    <p>Grant writing is always fun :-)  My favorite book on grant writing is "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Only-Grant-Writing-Book-Youll-Ever/dp/0786717548/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-0373043-7560868?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1184702810&amp;sr=8-1">The Only Grantwriting Book You'll Ever Need</a>" by Ellen Karsh and Arlen Sue Fox.</p>
<p>Of course, the easiest grant writing is when you already have a clearly articulated program or project with all the needs, goals,  objectives, metrics, and outcomes already defined. Then all you really have to do is slap a "gimme" to it and send it out the door.  Very rarely though does one seem to have all that :-)</p>
<p>Best of luck with the fundraising!</p>

				<p>I have been learning about the system we have set up at the CSL and doing odd hardware/software related jobs. In the course of learning about the technology I  look to find resources to learn from, and have found good ones. I think it would be a good idea to set up a group or a forum so that we could more efficiently exchange ideas, which is especially important with regards to technical questions. There are free forum hosts that have a good interface, but I would like to see if we could set up a CTC Vista forum on CSL servers. Also, there is Google Groups, but I think a forum would be better. If there are any organisations that need computers , hardware, etc, there is <a href="http://www.techsoup.org/stock/rci/" title="http://www.techsoup.org/stock/rci/">http://www.techsoup.org/stock/rci/</a> which provides hardware to non profits at ~20% market value. The conference/PSO was an excellent idea! It exposed people who normally wouldn't go to those  sort of things to a new and rewarding activity.</p>

	    <p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>I'm glad to hear that you're settling in at the CSL.</p>
<p>I appreciate the interest in setting up a forum or otherwise improving our VISTA communications.  We have had forums on the CTC VISTA website in the past; it is not especially difficult to set up with Drupal (which ctcvista.org is based on).  Unfortunately they tended to go under-utilized.  At the moment we have a triumvirate:</p>
<p>1) Listserv: immediate push out to people (at least those that don't filter it to trash)<br />
2) Field reports: chronological "journal" of what you've learned<br />
3) Wiki: information and resources that are incrementally improved</p>
<p>We're somewhat reluctant to add another facet to our communications infrastructure just because of the knowledge/explanation overhead for other VISTAs  (especially the non-technical ones) to understand its role.  That being said though,  if you think there are enough people on the listserv that would benefit from a more structured, but less immediate discussion, let us know and we can set up a forum and try it out.</p>

				<p>It's been an uphill battle this week with our internet service provider, who has been doing maintenance in this area resulting in major outages for Acorn's Chambana.net datacenter, along with all of the other network services in the building. Between me and my supervisor we've probably spent about 4-5 hours on hold with tech support over the last couple days. There's been a lot of talk about switching to some other ISP instead of Insight, but most of our options are significantly more expensive for little more capacity than what we already have. We are still hoping to get a deal with the city of Urbana for a fiber connection into the building, but that seems to have stalled for the time being. On the bright side, we've managed to find a couple of really nice 42u racks for only $100 a piece (these are worth more like $800) that belong to a friend of the project, and so we're going to be moving those into our server room soon, and it'll be a lot better than having our servers sitting on crappy wire shelves or on the floor. Still a lot of work to do getting Chambana.net up to spec, but I hope by the end of the year we'll have completely fast and redundant hosting services on real racks with gigabit ethernet, a fiber connection, battery backups, good electrical, physical security, HVAC, and good distributed management/monitoring capability. We hope to have our main website updated in the next couple of weeks, and I'm going to try and integrate all of our services into that drupal installation, including a donations page and a ticketing system.</p>
<p>On the wireless side of things, soon we're hopefully going to be getting a research grant from the NSF. We'll be able to do a lot of development and even a little hardware deployment with the money we'll get. We've also got a tentative deployment plan with the city of Urbana that will deploy three more nodes, after which we'll have all of the outdoor seating areas in the downtown provided with public wifi hotspots. We need to move fast on this because Urbana's adjoining city of Champaign just announced a deal with a company to deploy a proprietary wireless tech in their downtown, and we don't want them to beat us to the punch when we've been working on our grassroots OSS solution for the last three years.</p>
<p>Finally, got my loan forbearance and am applying for foodstamps, so I should hopefully squeak by at the end of the month here.</p>

	    <p>The city of Portland recently paid a private corporation millions of dollars to do something a community wireless project had already been doing for a few years. What a waste of money..

				<p>It is Friday afternoon, and I am about to conclude my first *official* week as a CTC*VISTA at Cambridge Community Television. To sum it up: I feel like I have been given the key to a secret door that leads to the land of 21st-century innovation.</p>
<p>I don't mean that in a dorky way...really. (Judging by the listserv emails, I'm quite the airhead compared to all you techies.) I just feel this is giving me a huge leg up over everyone else I graduated with 2 months ago. Ironically enough, I found out about CTC*VISTA through a job/internship opportunity newsletter of BU's College of Communication. It's ironic because I had never heard about CCTV at BU, even though it's located less than a mile away from the BU Bridge, offers full access to equipment, much more freedom to create content (as well as a larger viewership base than BUTV has), and classes that are simple to get into and teach you things like podcasting and HTML (while my multimedia class last semester merely taught me Microsoft FrontPage). I did hear about WGBH quite often, and it was through my internship there that I first heard about CCTV. The reason I am recalling this stuff is to emphasize what a turn of luck it was that brought me here. Ever since Penguin Day I've been realizing more and more what a necessary component this VISTAship is in completing my media education in today's world. (And I'm getting like $11,000 for it!)</p>
<p>I just read Meegan's comment about the Knight Foundation news challenge. I looked through the winners and saw organizations like Harvard and MIT...both involved in groundbreaking digital media projects, and both located around the corner from my host organization. Lisa Williams, founder of placeblogger.com and h2otown, resides in the neighboring community of Watertown and my supervisor just told me to set up a meeting with her. Not to be profane but...WTF!? This entire experience is blowing my mind right now. I'm going to have a blog on CCTV's website and I'm currently working on a new program (worthy of being crowned by the Knight foundation, I'd say) to place citizen journalists around the city and use all of CCTV's awesome resources to become the glue that holds these communities together. When the school year begins, I'm also going to be working in a state-of-the-art media studio (which I got to see the other day and it totally blows BU's facilities out of the water) to create new youth media programs for the educational access channels. I didn't even know what PEG access <em>was</em> a month ago...or open-source software, for that matter.</p>
<p>And the icing on the cake would be that the people here are all really great, and I get to interact with some really diverse members of the community.... and on days like yesterday, I even get to experience surprise visits from Sir Ben Sheldon himself!</p>

	    <p>Hey Julie,<br />
that's awesome to hear and read.  Starting a VISTA year is always exciting.  I'm doing it a second time and really loving it.  I was just asked to join a virtual community of media policy reformists all working towards democratizing media structures to the best of their ability using the power of networks.  Very cool for my first week of work.</p>
<p>In going through their database, <a href="http://www.namac.org">NAMAC</a> realized that CCTV is NOT a member.  Surely I would have though y'all were!</p>
<p>We're kind of an 'organization of organizations' and throughout the next year I'll be looking out for 'stories from the field' of independent media practitioners and indy media centers.  I look very forward to hearing more about your work with CCTV.</p>

				<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I am pretty well settled in at Help of Ojai's West Campus. It is not everyday when jails are converted to community centers! Many volunteers have been hard at work making the transistion from the feeling of a jail (bars cut out), painting, flowers carefully nurtured, and a new sense of openess abounds. The campus has 47 acres and is actually pristine, with well established, mature winter oaks and the sound of many birds along the creek beds.</p>
<p>The infrasture took me by surprise. The main buildings are connected with 12 strand multimode fiber and the offices have cat5 termination blocks in the closets with dual jacks in each end point location. Cool.</p>
<p>Since we are a non-profit we qualify for many very inexpensive buys through <a href="http://www.TechSoup.org" title="www.TechSoup.org">www.TechSoup.org</a> . Check them out. Cisco routers and switches. Microsoft licenses on the cheap. Many, many software wonderfull offerings.</p>
<p>We are in the process of bringing up a server in both locations and aquiring the electronics for the edges and the lab I will be building. 24 PC's with public access. A natural gas trolley will stop at the site and makes the rounds around town, 25 cents!</p>
<p>Sorta "build it and they will come" philosophy but attraction and promotion is in my task list. I'm having fun with this!</p>
<p>Best to All,<br />
Jim Mora</p>

				<p>hello there ctc vista project.  things here at homeless prenatal are going right along-- i'm unofficially the interim technology manager.  this means that i have been doing insane amounts of troubleshooting and teaching for both clients and staff.  in addition to managing the lab, i have also been working on creating policies and procedures, technology user guides and new website content as well as organizing the file server.  most of the guides are in the revisions process, so any suggestions for resources would be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>since my last post, i have had the opportunity to attend a couple of workshops including: one at the center for digital storytelling with <a href="http://www.ctcvista.org/user/968">jessica</a>, a drupal dream makeover course, an adobe interactive forms course and soon another photoshop course!  if you are interested, i can review and recommend (or not  recommend) the courses. </p>
<p> today i had lunch with the lovely <a href="http://www.ctcvista.org/user/813">morgan sully</a> at my favorite little <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/uGM7PAmP2utWXjYcZkVpQQ">taco truck</a> in the mission.  thank you $3 lunch. being with other vistas is quite nice.</p>

				<p>It is half way through our Summer Day Camp here in Tempe and we are super busy with kids here for 11 hours a day.  I had to put my fundraising on hold for a bit.  We were able to get 500 dollars, which I thought was my ceiling for my fundraising.  It turned out to be more in the 700 dollar range.  I got a new Computer Lab staff and he has being doing wonderfully with the kids.  He has them building bridges with freeware software, shooting videos, learning about the environment, and all around just keeping the children engaged during a time of year which can be very hard.  A couple of our teens attended a pilot program of ours called High Tech U.  This is an oppurtunity for the kids to experiance some of the technology field with tours of local factories and learning hands on how to make silicon chips.  It is an excellent opportunity for our teens to experiance some careers that might be available for them after they are finished with their education.</p>

	    <p>Well on the 4th we hit 117.  Is it sad to think of 105 as "not too bad"?  I am going to be freezing when I go back home.  We are just hitting monsoon season out here so the humidity increases from the 5-6% range into the 30-40 percent range which makes it very uncomfortable.  I am not sure I could take another summer like this.  I will be awaiting your call.</p>

				<p>My first day at my host org, I arrived minutes before the moving truck.  My organization got new digs and I was just in time to help set up.  On Weds of that week, we had the annual staff retreat out on Watauga Lake, and I got a good introduction to all the staff and various projects going on here.  As an environmental nonprofit, much of our work is the type of advocacy campaign that VISTA wants me to step carefully around.  My project is more of an education program -- teaching landowners about sustainable forestry techniques -- so that's my main focus.</p>
<p>Early in my second week, I sat down with several folks in the organization to get an in-depth feel for the sustainable forestry project and it's future.  We're planning a forum for landowners and forestry professionals, as both an online community and an information resource.  Much of the initial planning is done, but I get to carry the ball into the endzone.  This means working with the project partners, finding and arranging hosting, working with a professional web design company, developing initial content, and recruiting others to continue the content ....seems like most other aspects of the project (hopefully, with the exception of fundraising!).  Our in-house meeting went well and I'm arranging a conference call to introduce myself to our project partners.  </p>
<p>I'm also working on maintaining and extending their technical capacity, by assessing their needs and expanding their current capabilities.  I've already extended their LAN and WirelessLAN capabilities with an older Linksys WiFi router (I *heart* OpenWRT!).  The WiFi router provided by our DSL supplier, it turns out, doesn't play nicely with newer MacBooks.  </p>
<p>I'm working through an issue with their fileserver (minor things, ya know, like replacing a drive in the main RAID set that decided that Friday afternoon was the perfect time to die).  One drive dropped out of the RAID mirror, and I got the local volunteer who built the server to stop by and help me kick off a rebuild.  Most of the time this works fine and things are back to normal (the rebuild takes forever, but you can still access the existing drive).    Unfortunately, around 3pm last Friday I realized the network drive wasn't accessible, and sure enough the rebuild had encountered a serious problem with the offline drive (think "click of death").  I consulted our volunteer, rebooted the server, and waited until everyone was done for the day before trying the rebuild again.  Sure enough, the problem drive started making its click of death again, and the server locked up.  Now we're up and running, but without a mirror, and waiting for a replacement drive to come in.</p>
<p>I'm also rolling out an intranet webserver so I can evaluate and demo the CMS systems we're considering for my project.  The hard part in all of this is making it sustainable: documenting the setups and configurations that make all of this work, so that other techies can understand, duplicate, and extend the work I've done while I'm here.  Fighting tech fires is fun and all, but I won't be here forever, and those tech fires always flare up no matter how robustly the system is designed.  I'm thinking an intranet CMS could play that role here.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me if WDS is really helpful?  I'm debating the right way to make sure our facility is adequately covered by WiFi, and right now I've got two AP's that don't really cooperate.  (Well, only one answers DHCP, so it's cooperation, but our laptop users still see two different networks.)  I don't think I can get our DSL router to do much in the way of WDS, but I can probably get someone to donate another Linksys, then setup WDS between the two, one at the front of the facility and one in back, and just turn off the DSL router's WiFi altogether.  Any tips?</p>

	    <p>Hi Sil, </p>
<p>it sounds like you got a good orientation to the organization.  I wish we could have our PSO at the lake.  </p>
<p>Sounds like you have a lot on your hands and that is always the time for a hardware failure.  I hope you've backed up that sole hard drive :-)</p>
<p>I've used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Distribution_System">WDS </a>at my house and it works pretty well.  It does though halve your throughput (since half the bandwidth is reserved for inter-router communication).  You probably won't notice this though.  I've never used OpenWRT, but I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/">DD-WRT</a>.  Those linksys routers are pretty easy to come by---though watch out since the later hardware revisions won't run the custom linux firmware.</p>
<p>Thanks for the update!</p>

	    <p>Hey Sil,</p>
<p>Great post! I almost feel like I'm sitting there at work with you.</p>
<p>I went through quite a bit of work evaluating custom vs. open-source CMS options earlier this year with the StoriesForChange.net project, so let me know if you need any help in that area.  We put out an RFP so I got a good range of proposals from folks doing everything from custom CMS to Plone to Drupal. [We went with somebody doing Drupal, btw, because they included a really great technology planning component to the project planning.]</p>

	    <p>I've never had much opportunity to fiddle with it, but besides WDS you can also install OLSR through OpenWRT's package manager. It's an open-source mesh routing protocol, and while I'm not sure how much set up it requires, it can scale up to clouds of 5-10 nodes pretty easily (don't have exact specs for running it on WRT's, which are a little less than ideal for mesh node hardware). But it might be overkill for just two or three nodes. Of course the easiest way, unless you really need a reason for roaming through the building is just to partition the network. That's what we do here in our building, where we have "OpenUCIMC0-3" in different parts of the building, and they all route to the same physical subnet. If you can't run ethernet lines then you could also run two routers back to back, with one in wireless client mode and the other in AP mode. Finally, you could just get a big antenna. Super Cantennas (<a href="http://www.cantenna.com" title="http://www.cantenna.com">http://www.cantenna.com</a>) have pretty great signal penetration, we use two to provide coverage in a pretty huge old stone building. You could hook one up to your first WRT and just blast it through the whole building (depending on layout and the kind of materials your building is made of). Or just use WDS, which would probably work fine too. Just wanted to suggest some other options.</p>

	    <p>re: partitioning... are all your "OpenUCIMC0-3"'s on separate channels?  or are they all sufficiently far away that they can all coexist on the same channel... we're in a building too big for the Linksys by itself, but too small to put to AP's on the same channel.  hmmm.  the antenna option might actually be the right one; i'll have to dig farther into that.</p>

	    <p>I believe they are all on separate channels, though I'd have to go check to be sure. The thing to remember is that channels 1,6,and 11 are the only 802.11b/g channels which are fully orthogonal (if that's the right word). So if you have multiple routers, try and put them on those channels to minimize interference.</p>

				<p>Week 2 of my VISTA year was more of the same from the first week.  I'm still working on cleaning up the service listings for the counties on the 4People website.  While tedious, it's rewarding knowing that when people look at the county listings, they'll be more accurate with regard to the exterior links. (<a href="http://www.4people.org" title="www.4people.org">www.4people.org</a>)</p>
<p>One nice thing is that much of the work is done by telecommuting.  Last week I went in to the office only two days: one to collect the mail, the other to discuss how the clean-up project was going.  Misty (the other Vista) collected the mail 2 other days.  </p>
<p>On a personal note, I found out my horse has laminitis.  It's a good thing I brought her home -- she had been put on pasture for too long, too soon (one of the causes of laminitis is too rich a diet, such as too much pasture right after being on hay only).  Now she's on dry lot and can't go onto the pasture all summer (bummer).  I have to find a source of hay since I can only buy so many bales from my neighbor.</p>

				<p>Hey everybody.</p>
<p>Don't worry.  I didn't forget about my biweekly report.  I've just been superbusy what with changing apartments and starting this new position.</p>
<p>So far, I like what I'm doing which mostly involves cramming my head full of web development knowledge.  In the last two weeks, I have learned HTML, CSS, and a smattering of Drupal.  Along with that, I contributed to a 15 page report on Net Nanny software.  Right now, I'm getting set to start working on my first website:  a redesign for the NYC-based nonprofit <em>Concrete Safaris</em>.  Later, I think we're going to reorganize our content management system for the main site.</p>
<p>Did I mention that I'm in Columbus, too?  All of the Grassroots.org staff is getting together for a work retreat (the key word is "work") where we can meet each other, set our priorities for the larger picture of what we are working towards, and have some fun bonding over BBQ in the evenings.</p>
<p>My forecast for this upcoming year is that I am going to enjoy it for the most part and, along with that, learn a lot.  Most of the first couple month's is to get into the right mindset and understand the jargon that those steeped in technology take for granted.  I think I want to use the wiki as a way to give an idea about what I have learned and also use it as a way to clarify things that might not otherwise be completely transparent (ex. <em>What is a wiki?</em>)</p>
<p>I hope everyone else is doing well.</p>
<p>Ciao,<br />
Karl</p>

				<p>So I've been here for a little over two weeks. It's very interesting, I'm working on researching the digital divide. My first project has been to visit different communty computer labs and have them fill out surveys. I'm creating a database of all of the computer labs in tri-county area of Southern Florida. So far I've gotten about three organizations to fill it out and libraries have been taking them (and they have the capacity to get all of their branches, up to 50 in one pop, at a time). I'm still waiting for a lot of these surveys to come back though. I'm learning a lot about computers. I think I'm realistically on the wrong side of the digital divide. I hardly know anything at all but I'm learning. My favorite part of this job has been dealing with people and feeling like I can really help some of these non profits. We're not only creating a databse of computer access but also pinpointing computer lab needs (i.e. funding, grants, volunteers). There is one senior citizen computer lab who really wants a playstation, I think the request is kind of funny and I'm not even sure if it falls in my jurisdiction, but I'll see what I can do about helping them out. I've been working closely with Kevin Bulger, another VISTA at the Collins Center. And he's really helped to integrate me into the workforce. I got to meet with my supervisor for the first time last Thursday night and that helped me a lot with deciding which tasks to utlize my energy and focus towards. Still, there is alot of down time sometimes, and sometimes I wonder how efficent I am being. There is also a lot I still don't know, so I think I've got to be patient. Still all in all I'm really enjoying my first two weeks here.</p>

	    <p>If you're doing all that in two weeks, then you're being more than efficient!</p>
<p>We're doing almost the same exact project up here in Boston at MassIMPACT, trying to create a working database and map of Neighborhood Network technology centers (in housing developments), complete with a survey.  I've actually got a couple interns working on it, one of which is a former CTC VISTA, Shannon McCue, who's also doing a project to create a database of community technology resources for folks with disabilities.  We even hired Ben to build the database.  We should definitely compare notes.</p>

<p>It sounds like you have had a great start! Enjoy the downtime now, because I would be willing to bet that it will wane as your year progresses. :)</p>
<p>I see why you are amused by the Playstation. Have they explained why they want a Playstation? I think that it could be really cool. I actually know some seniors who play to maintain hand-eye coordination. I also know some seniors who play with their grandchildren as a means to create connection. I'm not saying there aren't other tools, but it demonstrates the practical (and productive) applications that are possible.</p>
<p>Keep up the excellent work!</p>

				<p>Today I will continue to determine on <em>campus infastucture</em>. I will be joined by a previous associate that used to maintain Fiber, phones, cat5, and closed circuit and CATV on the campus.  Since this was formerly a county jail in the "Jail to Jewel" model, there is exciting pre-existing infastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Yes,Yes</strong>! We just did a walk through and verified the infastructure at large. I know where the MDF is now.</p>
<p>The phone MPOE  has several cat5's that go to fiber optic access largely to the rest of the campus. The fiber terminates in IDF closets adjacent to punch down blocks to critical areas and the future computer lab location which is air conditioned. It is well-powered with its own PC location breakers and punched down to a 48 port cat5e patch panel. <strong><em>Cake</em></strong>. This goes to the MPOE where there is (3) T1 end points. This is exciting! </p>
<p>At the highest point there is a empty telephone that has power to it and a CATV cable to the MDF... Wi Fi anyone?? :-)))</p>

				<p>I'm looking for a more professional way for my organization to send out emails. Currently when we send out mass emails, we send them from our individual addresses and put our members' emails in the 'BCC' (or even the 'To') field. Once I used an Outlook plugin called "send personally," which sends individual emails to everyone in the "To" field. Ideally our organization emails would like to send emails our from something like 'announcements@our domain', we would have some way of managing where the replies go, and some way of managing two overlapping groups of contacts. So I'm wondering: do your organizations use specific email newsletter tools? Are they web-based (like the ones in <a href="http://www.idealware.org/articles/fgt_email_newsletter_tools.php">Idealware's rundown</a>) or locally installed software?</p>

	    <p>At the VISTA Project we use a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/">Mailman</a> newsletter list.  It's <em>the standard</em>... which doesn't necessarily mean it's that powerful or pretty, but it has basic features like individual emails and configurable From and Reply-To.  It's also nice because we can set up a form on the website where people can automatically sign up.  It came with our commercial hosting service.</p>
<p>It is important though how you manage your mailing list.  Depending on the services your nonprofit offers, it may fall under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN-SPAM_Act_of_2003">CAN-SPAM Act</a>.  Here is a decent article on determining if the CAN-SPAM Act <a href="http://www.ccfbest.org/webtechnology/canspamnonprofits.htm"> applies to you.</a></p>

	    <p>I definitely vote for Mailman. At my organization we use it to manage hundreds of email lists, and there's nothing more powerful and featureful around (the only competitive mailing list package I've come across is Sympa, which is needlessly cumbersome and complex). Ideally, you would have an MTA like postfix setup on your mail server to run email to Mailman. I'm by no means as expert as I could be on email systems, but let me know if there's any advice I could offer. If hosting your own solution isn't an option, I don't know enough about the commercial or web-based solutions to offer an opinion.</p>

				<p>I've been here two full weeks now and my boss has been gone for a week and 1/2 of that. Plus, she's going on vacay next week, so I'm kinda winging it. The good news about that is that I'm getting the opportunity to settle into the job and people watch while getting comfortable. The bad news is that my boss and a few others are the only ones that know I'm a VISTA. Everybody has been told, but apparently sharp memories are scarce around here. The sticky part is that the United Way has what they call a "loaned executive" program where companies extend their employees for a certain amount of time for a specific project here. People think I'm one of those and there are some serious territorial issues surrounding that and the money that goes with it. I've just stopped trying to correct people-they'll either get on board or get out of my way sooner or later I figure. I was told by one Senior VP of Resource Investment, in no uncertain terms, that I was not needed. When I asked what she thought I did, she admitted she didn't know-but she knew I wasn't needed. Funny.</p>
<p>So, I've got more of an uphill battle in a sharply divided workplace than I had originally thought. The really good news is that IBM and Sysco Inc. are funneling a lot of money into bringing the United Way's volunteering program online. It's self serving, they want a place to send their employees to volunteer so their community presence is increased--but hey, it gets me guaranteed volunteers! Right now, more than anything, I'm conducting research to help formulate a plan of action to get us more involved with our external volunteers and outreach. I've had positive feedback from my bosses and other more direct co-workers who actually understand what my position is. I'm very encouraged about the future of the project and where it can go--which is a good thing!</p>
<p>Next week I will be conducting interviews in a psuedo-digital storytelling medium as the program Teaming 4 Technology gathers data for grant applications. T4T distributes computers to organizations that apply to us to help bridge the digital divide. I'm going on the 10th to interview a center for the mentally handicapped and how they use their computers from us. I'm really looking forward to that. I'll try and post pictures. These kids come and fill our vending machines, so I've already met some of them and the staff and they're just fantastic.</p>
<p>I have amassed a tremendous amount of research and data on volunteer management in a broad sense. I'm going to try, when I get a chance, to post some of the better info and links on the Wiki, but until then-email me and I'll be glad to share if you need.</p>

	    <p>I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble being recognized around the office.  I'd recommend wearing the VISTA shirt, but honestly, I never wore it either (eww, polyester).  Maybe we should have sashes :-)  Of course, the best way to be recognized is for doing a great job, and it sounds like you're doing it.</p>
<p>We'd really appreciate any help you can provide on the wiki.  Also, we're trying to expand our library at CTC VISTA HQ, so please let us know if there are any books on volunteer management you can recommend.</p>
<p>Thanks for the update and keep up the good work!</p>

	    <p>Just keep showing up. Everyday. Work hard. Just like you are. People will get the idea. I've definitely been in the situation where someone introduced me as a VISTA and I was ignored/mitigated. Only after showing up and working hard day after day did people start to understand who I was as a VISTA.  Also if you want to shoot me whatever you're getting on the volunteer management front I'll post it to the Wiki for you. Nice deal on getting Sysco and IBM on board as a volunteer base, too!</p>

	    <p>Hey Kelli,<br />
Bummer about the 'huh? you're not needed' attitude you're encountering.  People sometimes miss just what a VISTA is - we're not exactly employees, nor are we volunteers - we're VISTAs.  When  I say 'domestic PeaceCorps' people seem to get it.  VISTAs do invaluable work around the country in many different regions and you're now writing a part of that 40 year old legacy with the work you do.</p>

	    <p>Thanks for you positive comments Morgan,I really appreciate it. I probably should have said more good things about the people I'm working with. The ones I'm actually WORKING with, and Ms. You're Superfluous isn't one of them, are really very positive and happy to have me. There are three people in the office that have actually been VISTAS before, 2 are my bosses. Surprisingly, the 3rd was an Americorps direct service for EIGHT years and she still snubs me. Go figure. So anyway, for the most part-my coworkers have been great. But I really appreciate your insight, thanks a lot!- Kelli</p>

	    <p>On the "explaining you're a VISTA" front, I have to admit, I pick my battles.  If I'm trying to get something simple, I may just go with "I'm an intern" but if I'm meeting community partners who count, I go into the spiel.  But what's really helped me is having a great supervisor (Thaddeus) who really gets what VISTAs do and having HIM explain it to people.  Maybe get a few people on board to take the giving the spiel off your shoulders alone.</p>
<p>ALSO - tell me more about this "psuedo-digital storytelling medium"?  Digital storytelling is sorta my gig this year...you should check out <a href="http://storiesforchange.net" title="http://storiesforchange.net">http://storiesforchange.net</a> and tell me what you think.</p>

				<p>So I just completed my first week of work at NAMAC and it went pretty well.  A bit slow as I get acclimated to the new work environs, but slowly starting to get more exciting as i look at the breadth and scope of the projects that await.</p>
<p>The upcoming projects of note are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Leadership Institute Network</strong>: this is actually an online social network that Dewey (the Senior Manager of Leader Services) developed using <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a> - it's purpose is the sustain the connections of leaders after their annual Leadership retreats.</li>
<p><br /></p>
<li><strong>Media Centers Map</strong>: this is an idea put our by Jack Walsh (Co-director here at NAMAC) to map all of the NAMAC members - and possibly beyond.  I was thinking of modeling it after Ben Sheldon's excellent <a href="http://mappingaccess.com/">Mapping Access</a> website.</li>
<p><br /></p>
<li><strong>Media History Timeline</strong>: already in existence, we'll be looking for way to integrate this into the current NAMAC website - perhaps connect it to some of the other technologies we have in the works.   Here's the link:<a href="http://www.mediaartsmovement.org/index.pl?task=timeline_view" title="http://www.mediaartsmovement.org/index.pl?task=timeline_view">http://www.mediaartsmovement.org/index.pl?task=timeline_view</a></li>
<p> <br />
<li><strong></strong></li>
<li>NAMAC Website Development:  over the next few months, I will also be completely reworking the website for NAMAC with an eye towards integrating some nifty social web apps to make it more dynamic and community dialog oriented.  I've been looking at the different tools out there keeping in mind NAMAC's Strategic Plan - how will each tool specifically attend to a part of NAMAC's plan and Mission?</li>
</p><p><br /></p>
<li><strong>Wikipedia Media Arts Page</strong>:  This was a quick idea thrown out yesterday during a staff meeting - way to increase member engagement by having members define the media arts - currently, no entry exists in Wikipedia to define the media arts as a field or practice.</li>
<p> <br />
<li><strong></strong></li>
<li>CTC VISTA Panel: This too will be a special project to engage CTC VISTAs and promote the CTC VISTA Project at the October NAMAC Conference - I'm thinking some stories from the 'frontlines' of some of the VISTAs serving at member (and non-member) orgs would be great.</li>
</p></ul>
<p>Over this week, I will be synthesizing all of this into a clarified workplan and present my findings at a Staff Retreat next Monday.   A big part of the retreat will be a discussion on what the new site will look like and how it will function + what the roles of each of the staff members here will be once it's up and running.  I'm of course thinking of using Drupal for this and it actually looks like the current hosts of the NAMAC site (Carnegie-Mellon's Center for Arts Management and Technology will be offering a free cms to NPOs based on open-spource CMSs - DotNuke, Drupal and Joomla).</p>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>

	    <p>Hey, I'm doing a center mapping project too - except we're just getting Ben to build it for us ;).  MassIMPACT is trying to verify what tech centers actually exist out in housing developments and get it on a nifty map.  Maybe there could be some overlap...I'm also thinking of putting a bug in Thaddeus' ear that the next step for the center map is to have the centers themselves start mapping other local community resources.</p>
<p>And man, I want to go to NAMAC conference BAD...I missed the boat for being a presenter though, right?  And I'm too old (a mere 31!) for the scholarships?</p>
