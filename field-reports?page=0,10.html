				<p>I wrote this for <a href="http://www.pcmtv.org/?q=blog/80" target="_blank">my PCM blog</a> and thought it might be interesting food for thought as a field report. The context for traditional journalism when participatory journalism appeared was one of threat. Ultimately, journalists realized that regardless of how they might disparage it, this participatory movement was here to stay and expand. A couple of years later, it's a way of life and a given when it comes to the Internet. Since I've been working at PCM, I've also been thinking about how social media/participatory journalism have not only been threats to traditional journalism but also to community media centers that cannot or choose not to adapt to the Internet as a distribution platform. Why is this? Because although community media centers have aimed to do for their constituencies what the Internet has allowed anyone with a connection to do (that is, to create media and have a distribution platform), the Internet does it on a much bigger scale and isn't concerned so much with the quality of production as much as it is the content. Fancy jib cams, twenty-inch lenses, top-notch microphones... none of those are necessary to create good media. Thanks to the Internet, media's become very DIY, and community media centers must not only latch on, they have to be ahead of the curb if they want to stay relevant.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pcmtv.org/?q=node/254" target="_blank">A CRASH COURSE ON CITIZEN JOURNALISM</a></strong></p>
<p>Or participatory media, as I like to call it, for more inclusive reasons.</p>
<p>One of my <a href="http://www.corante.com/amateur/articles/20030217-3668.html" target="_blank">favorite quotes about participatory journalism</a> is from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Canter" target="_blank">Macromedia founder Marc Canter</a>. “Five percent of the populace (probably even less) can create. The others watch, listen, read, consume. I think one of the destinies of digital technology is to enable the other 95% to express their creativity somehow. That’s the gestalt view.”</p>
<p>Back when I was in college, I wanted (and still entertain the idea) to be a journalist. Right before my senior year, a movement was beginning to gather steam, a movement called citizen journalism. </p>
<p>“Who are these people?” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Grossman" target="_blank">Lev Grossman</a> posed in <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1569514,00.html?aid=" target="_blank">Time’s 2006 Person of the Year</a> article. “Seriously, who actually sits down after a long day at work and says, I’m not going to watch <em>Lost</em> tonight. I’m going to turn on my computer and make a movie starring my pet iguana? I’m going to mash up 50 Cent’s vocals with Queen’s instrumentals? I’m going to blog about my state of mind or the state of the nation or the steak fries at the new bistro down the street? Who has that time and that energy and that passion? The answer is, you do.” </p>
<p>Everywhere I looked, on magazine covers, front pages and home pages, I saw three words: “Print is dead!” Columbia’s Dean of Journalism <a href="http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/cs/ContentServer/jrn/1165270069177/JRN_Profile_C/1165270081963/JRNFacultyDetail.htm" target="_blank">Nicholas Lemann</a> was not in such a rush to support the statement. In his mind, it was <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/08/07/060807fa_fact1?currentPage=all" target="_blank">amateur hour</a>, where at its best, you might get a couple of decent opinions, but more brilliant and polished insights on the matter are already available in the papers. He echoed the thoughts of many journalists at the time.</p>
<p>So who are citizen journalists and why do they do what they do? Here’s where the term “citizen journalism” falls apart. The term was coined by academics trying to name something they saw, a something where everyday people were creating worthwhile media distributed on the Internet. Other terms for it are participatory journalism, pro-am journalism and grassroots journalism. Of those that frame the movement in terms of journalism, I believe the most encompassing name is participatory journalism (Aside: In my personal opinion, the biggest reason citizen journalism isn't an adequate term is because &quot;citizen&quot; denotes geography, and this doesn't take into account diasporas, immigrant identities, or the unfortunate few who aren't protected under any citizenship). </p>
<p>Of course, there are many bloggers who see themselves as the alternative to mainstream media, but why participatory journalism? Well, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salam_Pax" target="_blank">Baghdad Blogger</a> put it best. His blog, <em><a href="http://dear_raed.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Where is Raed?</a></em> was the go-to source for on-the-ground information during the War on Iraq. As an Iraqi citizen, he had access to areas that even the most high-power<br />
journalists could not wander into. </p>
<p>“[Blogs are] good because they seem like small windows in to how people are living and thinking in the outside world. I also realized that there’s nothing coming from the Arab world. So I thought I’d start one. To give something back to the blogging community … Honestly, I’m not comfortable with the idea that I am considered a ‘news source.’ I am just blogging. A blog is where you can make the news more real for you… for me.”</p>
<p>The Baghdad Blogger wasn’t blogging with the intent of becoming an authority; he was writing what he saw in his little corner of the world in spite of politics, research and statistics. His accounts enhanced that greater entity called news. His facts were sensory ones.</p>
<p>“Let me tell you one thing first,” <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2083847" target="_blank">he wrote</a>. “War sucks big time. Don’t let yourself ever be talked into having one waged in the name of your freedom. Somehow when the bombs start dropping or you hear the sounds of machine guns at the end of your street you don’t think about your ‘imminent liberation’ anymore.”</p>
<p>Since graduating college, I’ve come across a couple of new terms: Web 2.0, social media, new media. All of this thanks to my position with Portland Community Media as the New Media Vista. Ultimately, all of these are very similar to participatory journalism, where normal and average people are choosing what goes on their front pages (Digg, Newsvine, Reddit) instead of journalists, where commenting on blogs can create a sense of community. Where people are fulfilling their need to share and create. Simply put, social media, new media and Web 2.0 are all terms referring to media that is driven by social desire and positive reinforcement. This media encourages dialogue and collaboration and uses technological tools to reinforce human social relationships. The difference between citizen journalism and social media are simply how they are phrased: One looks at everything from a social interaction perspective while the other focuses specifically on journalism.</p>
<p>This is clearly a powerful force, one that journalists, community media centers and marketers are trying to harness. At first, journalists begrudgingly accepted citizen journalism’s de facto existence, but are now scrambling to find a way to reinject the social aspect into news in order to secure their survival, which is ironic because news is ultimately about people. To understand this, it must also be understood that the way mainstream media have progressed in the last century is akin to a soup kitchen: The public was served predetermined headlines and portions with little say in what they wanted to have. It was an experts-to-advisee system. Broadcaster to consumers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the best citizen journalism and social media sites seem to keep three things in mind. One, that your public is a capable public with interesting and valuable information to share. Two, that everyone craves community and positive reinforcement. Three, that everyone--from the site’s members to the site’s administrator and hosting company--is both the broadcaster and the audience. Any social media or citizen journalism site takes a lot to maintain, but if participants are invested enough in the content they create, the quality and the warm fuzzies they get from social exchange, they can ultimately become monitors who watch out for vandalism of their media forum (i.e.: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>). </p>

				<p>I've never seen that movie...but since Richard Gere is in it, I'm sure I wouldn't like it very much at all. Anyway, I hope everyone is doing well in your respective locales across the country! Last week was pretty crazy with the election FINALLY happening..I didn't go to Times Square to watch the results, but in my opinion my couch was just as exciting.</p>
<p>In other news, things are going well at <a href="http://grassroots.org" title="Grassroots.org">Grassroots.org</a> - our team welcomed a new Executive Director recently and he has been pumping a lot of energy into the organization and putting a focus on the 'numbers' - measurable outcomes and how to track them. In addition, I'm now in charge of our volunteer web design program - thanks to an article posted on monster.com, we had a huge influx of 50+ new <a href="http://volunteer.grassroots.org" title="volunteers">volunteers</a> sign up with us!  So, nonprofits are getting matched with volunteers much more quickly which is great news. Here's our volunteer map:<br />
<img src="http://ctcvista.org/files/volunteer map.JPG" alt="" /></p>
<p> Also, we introduced our new World Lingo website translation tool and will be unveiling our graphic design program soon! </p>
<p>FYI, if your organization is not yet a member of Grassroots.org, refer your director to our <a href="http://grassroots.org/services" title="services page">services page</a> so that they can learn about all the free services available to you! And ask me or Alice if you have any questions..</p>
<p>Working on team Grassroots is a lot of fun - we work hard and reward ourselves with staff trips to Pinkberry! (Next time you are in Pinkberry, ask for Mochi, its the secret topping that my coworkers revealed to me mwahaha).</p>
<p>That's all - if you're in ze big apple, let me know!</p>

<p>For these past months of Oct and November, my biggest focus is my org's Asian Pacific American Leadership Symposium for high schoolers. I've been trying many outreach methods to high school principals, teachers, counselors, students and community orgs to allow students to take a day off from school to attend this event at UMASS Boston. The discouraging thing is that everyone loves the program and what we're doing (workshops on APA identity, history, culture and building networks and supports for both high school students and youth workers). However, many of the schools (with high Asian American student population) we relied on in the past are now resistant to allow adults and students to attend this event as a field trip (because it focuses more on leadership development and not what is relevant in the hs curriculum.) Ironically, this is why we've had the symposium in the past, to share our resources to hs students who aren't exposed to contents of Asian American experience and studies to connect to their work at schools and in their communities. </p>
<p>I also helped with the adult workshop which I was going to co-facilitate, however I will not be around for the  day of the symposium (Nov 20). The adult workshop is designed to focus on youth immigration issues: bilingual education, anti-asian sentiments and access to education for undocumented youth. This symposium is really important because it is a kick off event for the year to get more students involved with CAPAY or their communities; and to stay connected with schools and communities. I'll keep my fingers crossed and hope for 100 plus attendees; as my supervisor has said, people always register last minute, so you have to have faith that they will come.</p>
<p>While I was doing this project I realize as I was going through my org's database, that it's time for update of contacts and the database all together. So I will probably be working with Filemaker, because this is what they are still using (version 6.0). Hopefully I can figure out how to sync this program to send out e-mail blasts. This will take some time figuring out (especially if I can transfer files.)</p>
<p>Well, I will be leaving for Italy (Venice, Florence, Rome) this Saturday for 10 days.This will take off two wks of my November and soon enough the Holiday season will storm through.  Ciao!</p>

				<p>It’s getting cold here! The trees are all losing their beautifully colorful leaves and it’s pretty much no turning back at this point- I am about to experience my first New England winter. And I’m very, very scared. </p>
<p>The other day I was talking to Andre from Salvation Army about the upcoming winter. He stopped by the gallery during a benefit show that we had for them. According to him, I’m probably going to be reduced to a wimpering child before the winter is over. He said it gets so cold here it will make my fingers bleed. Awesome. </p>
<p>Speaking of the benefit show, it was a great success. xQuicksilverx spearheaded a collaboration with some local bands that packed the house and raised some money for the Salvation Army. It felt good to be part of that.  </p>
<p>It’s almost time for the ‘Zine show to come down and I’ll be sad to see it go. We have some amazing cover art on the walls, some of it even hand painted on wood block. Plus there’s something pretty rad about being able to hang out on a comfy couch while at work. And that part of my job is to read graphic novels? Who could ask for more?</p>
<p>Other than that, I’ve been just focusing on getting everything for our annual fundraiser. On Nov 16 we will be screening Jean Cocteau’s 1947 silent film 'La Belle et La Bete.’  If that wasn’t exciting enough (there is most definitely a soft spot in my heart for silent films) local gothic cellist Wisteriax has been hard at work on an original soundtrack that she will be playing live during the screening. AND all of this amazingness will be accompanied by lasagna. And wine. So if you live anywhere near me, I expect to see you there.

				<p><img src="http://dennetmintoncorps.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/website_home-page.png?w=300&amp;h=224" width="320" height="240" alt="website_home page" align="right" /><a href="http://www.pcmtv.org/">From July onward, I've spent much of my time at Portland Community Media</a> working on a proposal for a project that would allow immigrants and Millennials to create media at low-cost anywhere and at anytime. To do this, we focused on the cell phone as a media creation device and the Internet as the primary distribution platform with the hope of television as a second one. Here's how the idea began:</p>
<p>After coming back from Africa, I have a deeper appreciation for the immigrant experience. As a minority, I could only superficially understand the immigrant struggle till my experience as a <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/">Peace Corps</a> volunteer in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesotho">Lesotho</a>. In addition to this, there’s very little ethnic diversity in Portland, and I was curious why, out of the major West Coast cities, it had been excluded from the richness of cultural infusion.<br />
My first day on the job as a CTC Vista, I had a talk with Jason, who managesthe government production side of PCM. I was asking about immigrant representation on PCM channels and programming done by immigrants, of which Jason said there was very little. We talked about the lack of outreach by PCM to immigrant communities in the area even though it’s in line with the mission, and we discussed the need for their presence in community media in Portland.<br />
Having come from print journalism, I have a penchant for paper. Bea, my supervisor, shares this as a bookbinder. We discussed what would be the most comfortable and familiar medium for immigrants. Despite my position as the New Media Vista, I really wanted to bring print into PCM. We decided that, of all forms of media, paper is the most familiar in the world and probably the most comfortable form of communication that anyone can opt for.<br />
Since I was hired on to be the New Media Vista without really understanding what the buzzword of “New Media” and “Web 2.0” were, I was also researching heavily during my first couple of weeks on the job. I read a lot about social media and also came across <a href="http://mobileactive.org/">this website</a> focusing on the phone as an activist tool. It was incredibly interesting for me to learn how phones were being used for flash mobbing and information distribution in third world countries.<br />
At the time, my boyfriend was also about to replace his shitty phone and was intently scouring the Internet for new cell phone technology and customer ratings. I asked him about transferring contacts, SMS’, and other forms of data from his old phone to a new one. I remembered how all my phones used to have a voice memo feature and the short amount of time it allowed for recording. I figured this was anywhere between 1-10 minutes because I used to accidentally hit the voice memo feature on my old cell phone while on calls. I realized how that might be a possibility for new media use for immigrants and thought it might be appropriate technology because of what I saw in Lesotho: Everyone has a cell phone regardless of how remote they are, and a lot of it is driven by the phone as a status symbol. "Everyone" is a bit of an exaggeration, but I later learned that the most familiar and bestselling communicative technology device in the world is the cell phone, which suggests that the phone is at least more familiar than other new communication media.<br />
I started to test the technical side of this idea with phones that belonged to coworkers and friends. The goal was trying to figure out the average amount of time that the memo feature records, and that’s where I discovered that, in fact, not all phones have voice memo features, and phones range in recording time from a minute to whatever amount of memory is left on the phone.<br />
It was around that time that Bea put Jacob and me together on a project to figure out how PCM could address the needs of both immigrant communities and Millennials. PCM has a very hard time retaining Millennials at the facility, and yet they are some of the most media active and social justice oriented people in Portland.<br />
Eventually, I stumbled upon a social networking site called “Utterz,” (now known as <a href="http://www.utterli.com/">Utterli</a>), and although the hope of the voice memo feature was zero-cost media creation, it seemed that a system like Utterli (people dial in to record memos and interviews) was the best compromise between cell phone plans and incongruencies in cell phone features. Utterli, however, is a free form social media site, and Portland Speaks has more of a focus in the form of target groups.<br />
However, following a group brainstorm and dissection, Jacob and I felt <img src="http://dennetmintoncorps.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/website_main-user-page.png?w=300&amp;h=224" width="320" height="240" alt="website_main user page" align="left" />somewhat confused and disillusioned since our parameters were loose and our ideas were being scrambled, so I set out to define the original idea and it burgeoned into the attached proposal and illustrations. It was then decided that the idea would be submitted for the Knight Foundation's News Challenge grant (our application can be found <a href="http://generalapp.newschallenge.org/SNC/ViewItem.aspx?pguid=4a4f8c6a-d2c2-4545-82db-c8ed4b415eba&amp;itemguid=e9c68308-afa1-4c6c-a991-b71a8c76c997">here</a>).<br />
All in all, this has been an incredible learning process with lots of creativity but also some incredibly devastating downs. Welcome to the real world, I guess.</p>

	    <p>I do want to say that I feel fairly disillusioned after the whole process. You know how they always warn that when the real world hits people lose their idealism? I'd put a twist on that and say I feel disillusioned because of how important credentials are to have creative oversight (the higher you climb, the more you can get) and how, even if you work to deserve a break, there's still that variable of unfairness as the real world standard. A vague comment, but there it is. As my friend put it, we have to make that choice between selfishness and selflessness, each with its own consequences.</p>

				<p>Month 3 (September 15-October 15) saw the growth of the IMC Production and Video News efforts that I began in the previous month.  Together with other volunteers I recruited, we covered five on-location events where we recorded interviews, filmed, and took notes to share with other community journalists.  We finished video previews/announcements about a local campaign to end truancy and a city Unity March that brought 150 people from different backgrounds together to support the local poor and to participate in county government.  We also attended a reception for artists and art-buyers, a beer and chili festival, and a panel discussion on the challenges faced by African-American male youth.  Our reputation grew as a voice of the people, and I used the opportunity to train another 15 volunteers on video editing, field audio recording, and radio broadcast.</p>
<p>	Back at the IMC, I helped update the IMC web site by replacing old documents and language, and calling Web group meetings.   I really did not do much else on the web site, though, and real credit is due to VISTA leader Josh King, who fully upgraded the site to the latest version of Drupal and also redesigned it to be more striking, effective, and bug-free.  Trying to focus more on the a/v media projects at the IMC, I organized a group of Music Library volunteers to update the WRFU automation system, adding new PSAs, station IDs, and local music, and getting this database ready for publishing on our site.  I continue to work with WRFU to make sure that its members can consistently produce new content for the station, and Production room maintenance and improvements are a slow part of reaching that goal.  By the way, I’ll point VISTAs to ZaraRadio and SHOUTcast as good tools for community broadcast.</p>
<p>	For several weekends, I organized volunteers in the IMC Shows group to raise funds for the IMC by sponsoring some concerts during the Pygmalion Music Festival.   We packed up, set up, and tore down our PA about seven times in three or four different venues, but we got to assist and listen to some great music by local and non-local performers while getting out into the campus and raising some money for ourselves and area businesses.  We played loud rock music in the middle of a clothing store – and then in a vegan restaurant, which was incidentally voted the best venue in the festival.  We got to stand on stage in front of Dan Deacon when that very stage collapsed under the weight of his wild, raving audience and we worried that our speakers might not make it out alive.  We were exhausted by the end of those shows and I still haven’t received our check to give to the IMC for the time, labor, and equipment.</p>
<p>	Looming in the background of all these activities was a growing body of direct service that I was doing back at the IMC.   During both September and October, I was responsible for calling meetings, taking notes, and facilitating the weekly operations of at least two IMC working groups – Shows and Production – and was often doing the same for other groups.  It was ultimately the Shows group that began requiring too much from me and relying too much upon me.  Since August I had been the only person administering the events/concerts calendar, responding to booking requests, reviewing contracts, and even running live sound and security at shows.  Earlier this month I realized that no one else was volunteering to do these things, and that I could no longer do so, either.  The more often people who came into the building associated me with the shows, the more they would come to me and write to me – instead of the group – for their requests, both big and small, while the other members of the group stopped showing up, or when they did show up, made such a mess of things technically and figuratively that I had to fix things or respond to angry “customers.”  It was annoying on one level and aggravating on another, especially because it prevented me from focusing on developing media training curriculum and building community teams.  As recently as one week ago, I found it harder to get project goals done at work than I did at home, because I was distracted by requests unrelated to my position, and I found it to be a very different and more negative interaction with the public than our video news outings.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was merely the long summer-like weather that kept everyone active and busy through the end of September and beginning of October – so busy that I found myself taking on the tasks of other volunteers at the IMC, which seriously cut into my VISTA project work.  Overall, it was a good month if for no other reason than I learned a valuable lesson and communicated my frustration with my organization in a way that was well received and constructive.</p>
<p>	The problem stems from an admirable philosophical commitment to volunteering at the IMC.  There is hardly staff, decisions are made in consensus, and groups organize themselves around common goals and skills.  So, what happens when a non-profit with no staff suddenly gets “staff” members (two VISTAs)?  The new staff are asked to do everything from answer visitor requests in the office, to file leases and contracts and burn bulk copies of DVDs – because we’re there and no one else is, since everyone else is just a volunteer and shows up when they feel like doing so.  Nevermind that we are also volunteers, that we are not being paid employee wages, and that we have specific long-term projects that ought to take up a major portion of our time.</p>
<p>	None of this is really the fault of the IMC, but has more to do with group dynamics and my offering up too many of my services.   Ultimately, I noticed this well enough in advance, and had the support of people like Josh and Nicole, to address the issues before they became too difficult to manage.  I imagine that other VISTAs have had similar experiences in their organizations; do not be afraid to politely but firmly tell people what your job is and what it is not, especially when they are unloading a lot of their tasks, hopes, and expectations onto you.</p>

				<p>I am submitting two reports at once this time.  The past two months were so busy that there was little time to reflect or to write about what was going on. </p>
<p>During the second month at my organization, I delved further into media training and started an active video news project with some volunteers.    Most of my work this month was interactive and in the community, so in contrast to my plans, I did not have much time to write training manuals.  A notable exception was authoring a revised Airshifter Handbook for WRFU 104.5-LP, our community radio station, with an extra manual on remote/live broadcast and streaming radio.  The last version of the handbook had been written two or three years ago, and lacked a discussion of the goals of the organization or a studio checklist for DJs new to the radio.  After talking with the Station Manager, we realized that a new handbook alone would not have much effect unless we also scheduled small group training sessions so we could discuss the social, legal, and technical aspects of running a community radio show.  Our efforts were successful and now WRFU has an established program for orienting new DJs and getting new shows on the air, while respecting the needs and goals of the IMC as a whole, which includes other groups beyond the radio station.</p>
<p>One of those other groups is IMC Production, a volunteer group that I helped create in order to carry on and combine the legacies of the separate Video and Radio News groups that ceased to exist around two years ago.   Simply put, all the IMC groups make sure that some different aspect of independent media is alive, productive, and engaged with the local population.  Production is here to create audio-visual content for the community and for other groups, and to provide the facilities and personnel to make this possible.  While our work to improve the studio is slow, in only my second month as a VISTA, we were able to initiate IMC Video News.  IMC Video News actively searches for local or regional stories that are not being covered by other stations, goes out on-site to interview and shoot, and then edits and produces short-length film for distribution online and on Urbana Public Television.  Even though others in the IMC look to us for technical multimedia advice, we spend far more time interacting with the public than sitting in front of computer screens editing.  This has turned out to be very beneficial for our organization’s outreach and public relations, because we are listening to – and publishing – voices that others are ignoring.</p>
<p>In September, we produced segments on a Greenpeace Solar-Powered Concert (where I ran the mixer, too – next to a solar panel the size of a roof) and the closing of Illinois State Parks.  We also assisted with an Iraq Veterans Against the War forum on post-traumatic stress disorder (for UPTV) and re-published the local Books to Prisoners’ Our Volunteer Experience film online.  A sample of our work to date can be accessed on our new <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/UrbanaChampaignIMC">UC-IMC YouTube Channel</a>.  To get this project going, we have been using Adobe Premiere, but we will be expanding to incorporate more open-source software for editing.  Two open-source/freeware video utilities that have been crucial to my work here have been <a href="http://handbrake.fr" />Handbrake<a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mp4cam2avi" />MP4CAM2AVI</a>.  Of course, <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net" />Audacity</a> is a robust, simple, and reliable solution for audio editing that I would recommend to anyone and which most people seem to know, anyway.  Though not technically free (you can use it for free with no features suspended or get a license for $50), I recommend Windows’ <a href="http://www.reaper.fm" />Reaper</a> for multi-track audio editing and sequencing because it is easy, allows for flexible routing, comes with high-quality processing built-in, and accepts most free or commercial VST and DirectX plugins.</a></a></p>
<p>It doesn’t end there, though.  The <a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com" />Sunlight Foundation</a> webinar that I scheduled between members of WRFU, Production, and Public i (the IMC’s independent newspaper) was a small event, but so useful that I am posting the links here for CTC VISTAs to view.  Bill Allison guided us through an overwhelming tour of websites that allow any citizen with Internet access to closely investigate the finances, bills, and records of members in the United States Congress, as well as information on lobbyists, federal contracts, and elections.  Obviously, these types of topics and data are of great interest to journalist and media organizations like mine in the IndyMedia network, but this set of links provides another set of tools that all community organizers can use to bridge the digital divide and help the groups they are working with attain greater access to knowledge and the political process in their states and in the nation:</p>

			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p>A key skill of any knowledge worker or online community manager is the ability to <em>listen</em> to the internets.  A lot of engagement around topics, brands or issues important to their particular line of work is important to building their professional capacity.  However,  a lot of engagement sometimes happens on websites not their own (or their organization's).  How do you monitor and track this?  Where are these conversations and engagements happening on the internet and how can you find them without getting lost?  'Listening' is the obvious answer, but how?</p>
<p>Here's two tools I developed for listening, as well as use cases for them.  I included links to related tutorials at the end of the post.</p>
<p><strong>A "Federated Search" of NAMAC's Membership</strong>:<br />
<a href="http://www.namac.org/federated-search-beta"><img src="http://ctcvista.org/files/namac-federated-search.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
A 'federated search' is term used to describe a restricted search across a specific list of websites.  They work particularly well for 'association' type organizations/businesses.  They provide a great way to search JUST the websites comprising the 'federation' of websites affiliated with an org or business.  In less than 15 minutes, I built one for my org:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.namac.org/federated-search-beta" title="http://www.namac.org/federated-search-beta">http://www.namac.org/federated-search-beta</a></p>
<p>Here's how I used mine:</p>
<p>I really like the idea of '<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/05/05/future-of-making-map.html">independent makers</a>'  in our Membership, but am also curious how it ties into our <a title=" (a good rule of thumb is to tie your technology efforts to existing initiatives for maximum effectiveness and leadership buy-in)">policy initiatives</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>As I know 'policy' is as important to NAMAC's direction as our Member base, I did a search to see if  'independent makers'  is being spoken about alongside 'policy' issues in our Membership.</li>
<li>I did a search using the Google Custom Search tool I made and found:  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/independentmakerssearchresults" title="http://tinyurl.com/independentmakerssearchresults">http://tinyurl.com/independentmakerssearchresults</a></li>
<li>While the results indicate that the idea of 'independent makers' is not tied very strongly to policy within our Membership (or at least not mentioned on their websites) - the idea IS out there among a few members: </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Center for Social Media</strong> in their <a href="http://www.centerforsocialmedia.org/files/pdf/Free_Culture_Conference_Report.pdf">Next Generation Strategy for Media Democracy and Participatory Culture</a>mentioned it as a very strong idea in the Free Culture Conference in 2006 (according to ther PDF) - they also have a list in the PDF of participants in the conference (some are CTC VISTA recipients!)</li>
<li> <strong><a href="http://www.namac.org/node/3973">Standby Program</a></strong> has it as an actual word in their mission statement</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/history/people/ptext.php3?id=61&amp;page=1">Experimental TV Center</a></strong> has been speaking about it since 1980!</li>
</ul>
<p>From this, we can start to think a little bit of how to 'connect the dots' strategically within the context of net-"working" our Membership as well as ask a few more questions to further our inquiry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where else might our Membership might be expressing a voice on these topics (any suggestions, dear reader?)? </li>
<li>Where else might interconnections be found?</li>
<li>If not found else where, might it be something we build out? </li>
<li>How might the Advocacy and Policy area (or any new site area) fit in? </li>
<li>What are key organizations (aside form the ones found here) should we follow?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>An Aggregated Online 'Listening Post'</strong>:<br />
<a href="http://www.netvibes.com/namac-listening-post"><img src="http://ctcvista.org/files/namac-listening-post.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
This one was fun to make and had some nice ingredients:<br />
<a href="http://ctcvista.org/node/1358" how to stay informed ctc vista using rss and google></a></p>
<ol>
<li>RSS feeds from a few NAMAC Members</li>
<li>'RSS-ified' searches of a few key topics/terms</li>
<li>A flexible 'aggregator' to house all the information (I used NetVibes)</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's the results of mashing up the above ingredients: <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/namac-listening-post" title="http://www.netvibes.com/namac-listening-post">http://www.netvibes.com/namac-listening-post</a></p>
<p>I won't go in to too much detail here, of a use case, but I do refer to it occasionally, just to get a 'pulse' of what's happening.  I think of it as like a personal cnn.com, but for our Membership instead.  Ideally, our org's own website would function a bit like this (but it'd of course look cooler:)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br />
This is stuff I think about all the time while I'm in my decision making process around technology and engagement on social networks.  I'd imagine that one's community is the first and best resource for any kind of movement building/social change - that's why we're here, right?</p>

				<p>Well guys, I've been working really hard (too hard to excuse not filing a field report….probably not) and I realized I haven't submitted one yet.  Either way, I have been busy and I'd love to fill you in on what I've been doing.  As you may or may not know, I’m working with the Puget Sound Center for Teaching, Learning, and Technology, located in Bothell, WA and I serve as the coordinator for the TechREACH Alliance Project ( <a href="http://www.psctlt.org/tap" title="www.psctlt.org/tap">www.psctlt.org/tap</a> ).  One of the main tasks I was charged with was updating our old (and not quite up to date) curriculum.  I spent pretty much all of September working on these new documents for the club leaders to use with their students.  I made some new, and snazzy if I say so myself, power points to help demonstrate the different parts that make up a computer, and how to take one apart.  I also helped to update the 70-or-so page document that will be distributed to each student and the accompanying club leader guide.  I was able to team up with Karen Meyer, basically the curriculum specialist at the Puget Sound center and she really took the information I had compiled and tried to make curriculum, into curriculum.  I’m really happy with the end result and if anyone wants to check it out, I’d be happy to share.  I attached a word document with the first couple chapters of the student materials.  Take a peek if you want.  </p>
<p>	So, we had a deadline to finish this curriculum because we had our first club leader training last Monday, October 13th.  We distributed all the new club leader materials and I presented the new activities and information we added.   It was a packed day and we covered a lot of important topics: computer refurbishment, club recruitment, student retention, holding a computer distribution, and last year’s evaluation results.  We just got back the surveys from the training and almost all the responses were positive and confirmed we had a very successful orientation.</p>
<p>	So now that the club leaders have been trained I’m really looking forward to my next duties as coordinator.  I’m going to travel to each of the clubs and sit in and see how what I wrote works in the classroom.  I’m really excited to meet some of the kids and evaluate what works and what doesn’t.  And as an added bonus, I’ll be able to travel all across the state of Washington on PSCTLT’s budget (YES!!).   In addition to stopping by the clubs, I’m also in the process of compiling some information and resources for the end of year computer distributions and what we at the PSCTLT (rolls off the tongue, doesn’t it?) have named “Technical Assistance Workshops” (TAWs), which are basically just what they sound like, classes for recipients to learn more about the computers they have.   We’re working closely with the Department of Social and Health Services of the state of Washington to make partnerships and provide trainings for the families that have received computers (this is TAP’s second year).  So basically I’m compiling information and making partnerships.  It’s kinda fun.   </p>
<p>	Now I’ll include a personal update because this is my first field report and I’m trying to make up for missing my first two.  So, let’s see.  Living situation is great.  I’m sharing a two bedroom apartment with my twin brother on First aka Pill Hill in Seattle.  Kinda a big deal for me considering Kenyon (where I went to college) didn’t have off campus housing, so it’s my first apartment!  Buying groceries still has some sort of novelty that hasn’t worn off yet.  Unfortunately, First Hill is known as Pill Hill because of the inordinately large number of hospitals located in that area.  This means ambulance sirens.  All. The. Time.  It’s actually not too terrible and I guess I’m getting used to it, but compared to the tranquil central Ohio birdsong it’s a change.  One of the bonuses of living in that area means I have a decent commute.  Bonus you ask?  How is a long commute a bonus?  Well let me explain, Seattle has this really sweet bike path (The Burke-Gilman bike path) and I can ride it home from work.  Door to door it takes about 1.5 hours and it’s about 22 miles or so and the majority of it is on the bike path.   I’m really glad to be biking almost daily (I work from home on Fridays (SWEET!!) and getting a pretty decent workout.  In addition, this means I don’t have to pay for gas / any car related expenses but at the same time, bike repairs can be costly.  In the past few months I’ve broken a spoke, my seat post, had 3 flat tires, been the target of some road rage (dude threatened me with some sort of object (Lead pipe? Hatchet?  Knife?)), and almost died or got into a serious accident.  Overall, I like riding the bike and I don’t foresee any reason to stop soon.  Seattle winters are fairly mild or so I’m told.  And the investment I just made in some rain pants and tights leaves me with no excuses.  </p>
<p>Well, that sums things up for me.  I’m looking forward to seeing some of you other VISTAs at the CTCNet conference in November.  Until next time….</p>

	    <p>Hey Will,</p>
<p>I hope you have a helmet! I wish there were more bike paths around here, we have so many crazy drivers from the local university that it gets pretty hazardous. Sounds like it's pretty hazardous there, too. Maybe we should all have government-issued brass knuckles to protect ourselves on the job.</p>

				<p>Time goes by so quickly here in the mountains, but maybe that's because I've spent a good portion of the past month away from Whitesburg. I was in Oakland, CA, for a week for the <a href="http://www.criticalresistance.org" title="CR10">Critical Resistance 10th Anniversary Conference</a>. It was a great week of meeting people, and learning about other organizations and resources. And I got to lead a workshop. First I had volunteers from the workshop session read the Thousand Kites Play aloud.  In this informal staged reading, a diverse group of voices were heard and a variety of experiences with the criminal justice system were expressed. Act 2 of the play is the audience's chance to tell their story. We heard from a man who was formerly incarcerated, a woman who's boyfriend is currently incarcerated, among others. It was a great conversation and I think that people walked away with some actions steps. Next time I do the presentation there are things I would like to do differently, but for a first go around, I think it went alright.</p>
<p>I also went to a session that was a planning group for a national coalition for prison arts work. I joined the technology team (so as to use all my new ctc skills!) and have created the <a href="http://theprisonartscoalition.wordpress.com/">blog</a> for the group.This isn't technically part of my job, but my organization is part of the coalition, and it's something that's important to me, so I'm excited about it.</p>
<p>Last week I went to the <a href="http://thirdcoastfestival.org/">Third Coast International Audio Festival</a> in Chicago and learned so much about radio! As I am a weekly radio producer, it seemed like a good festival for me to go to.  Many big NPR personalities were there, and I learned a lot about radio documentary, and also about using social media to promote the work. It was a cool conference, indeed.</p>
<p>In the past month we also finished up the facilitation guide <img src="http://www.thousandkites.org/storage/appalshop/documents/thousandkitesfacilitationguide.pdf" alt="" /> (attached) and have revamped the website.  So now I'm finally able to really start in on our StoryLine project, which will use a digital google map as the key element. Right now I'm working on getting audio files into the website, and doing outreach to get more people to share their stories.  </p>
<p>And next week I'm starting a creative writing workshop in the nearby women's prison. I'm hoping that eventually I'll be able to turn it into a digital storytelling workshop and since they have computers there it might be possible.  That's not work related. It's just fun.</p>
<p>So needless to say, I'm busy down here. But the weather is still good, and I'm still getting some good hiking in!</p>
<p>And yes, I hear the banjo almost daily in my office. What would a good appalachian office be without a banjo?</p>

				<p>Thought I'd share a more appropriate post that I wrote for the PCM blog a couple of days ago. This is probably what I should be submitting for my field reports...</p>
<p>-----<br />
<H2><a href="http://pcmtv.org/?q=node/247">Digital storytelling: The wonders never cease</a></h2> <em>10 Oct. 2008</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>I've had the privilege of being part of two digital storytelling workshops at <a href="index.html" target="_blank">Portland Community Media</a>: once as sort of a teacher's aide and the second time as a participant.</p>
<p>I first heard of digital storytelling in 2006 as I was rounding the corner to my last semester in college. I was home for winter break and decided to take advantage of my locale to learn about media centers in the San Francisco Bay Area. I met Theeba Soundararajan of <a href="http://www.cultureisaweapon.org/" target="_blank">Third World Majority</a> (TWM) and Jessica McCoy, who was the <a href="http://ctcvista.org/" target="_blank">CTC Vista</a> for <a href="http://www.storycenter.org/" target="_blank">Center for Digital Storytelling</a> (CDS) at the time.</p>
<p>Both were storytelling organizations with slightly differing missions. They're media centers focused on expression, but TWM was more focused on giving minorities and immigrant communities the media tools that have traditionally been used to ignore, suppress or misrepresent them. </p>
<p>Theeba opened my eyes to digital storytelling as a tool for those who have been sidestepped and wrongly represented on the local and national scene. As a person who has trained in journalism, I've seen much of this and even experienced it, which can be very jolting for someone who plays on both sides. </p>
<p>I've had a couple of experiences now, but the most shocking was after returning from <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/lt.html" target="_blank">Lesotho</a> as a <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/" target="_blank">Peace Corps</a> volunteer and hearing an NPR <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/" target="_blank" title="Marketplace">Marketplace</a> broadcast entitled <em><a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/01/15/lesotho_tensions/" target="_blank">Chinese businesses rile Lesotho locals</a></em>. To establish the scene, there's a lot of resentment against the Chinese by Basotho because<img src="http://www.bridgehouse.org.za/image.php?img=uploaded/2004/11/29/Round%20Logo.jpg&amp;max_area=90000" width="301" height="298" alt=" Made in South Africa" align="right" /> the Chinese have been economically successful there while the Basotho are cementing themselves in poverty. As a Chinese American, <a href="http://dennetmint2lesotho.wordpress.com/2007/11/18/living-in-lesotho-first-of-the-series-in-three-sketches/#machaina" target="_blank" title="Living in Lesotho">I experienced a hefty amount of misdirected discrimination</a>. The Marketplace broadcast seemed to side with the idea that the Chinese were snatching up every economic opportunity, leaving nothing for the Basotho. Granted, there are sketchy business decisions that <em>some</em> Chinese have made, but the Basotho are in their particular position most of all because of lack of entrepreneurial spirit (my official title as a PCV was &quot;Small Business Advisor&quot;). It was disturbing to hear the NPR report not because I share a physical appearance with the Chinese, but because I had experienced both sides and could not believe the lopsided situation an NPR show represented. Talk about a group that's exploited Lesotho's economy, where was any mention of South Africa and their complete infiltration into Basotho commodities and cultural goods? In many ways, Marketplace legitimized the discrimination against Lesotho's Chinese community. I still haven't heard a peep after writing a letter to the editor, not even acknowledgement of receipt.</p>
<p>Of course, this goes on everyday. There are countless misrepresentations in the news, and while it's hard to combat if you have limited media resources at your hand (which I've also experienced), it's even harder when you have none. In that case, there's no reason to even cultivate an audience.</p>
<p>Jessica and I spent much more time talking about the role of storytellers and story holders. Storytellers in our society can be seen as journalists, filmmakers, politicians--those who don't tell their own stories but tell other people's. Story holders are the people whose stories are being told. The big question for me at the time was if storytellers and story subjects share the intent of confronting readers with a question, is it better for the storyteller to tell it or the story holder? An unresolved question, but ultimately, we came to the conclusion that as nonprofessional storytellers, story holders have much more power to eschew pretenses and rules, dramatic questions, rhetoric or otherwise. Doing personal storytelling also serves to empower people in addition to getting the word out.</p>
<p>Back to the present-day, where I've been a part of two digital storytelling workshops. The first digital storytelling workshop I attended was a partnership between PCM and CDS. One particular person's story was about her predicament as an illegal immigrant who grew up in the US and knows no other home than the States. She doesn't qualify for college scholarships (a heavy burden for any student, especially spotlighted now in our recent economic crisis) because she'd have to prove citizenship. She speaks of looking &quot;American&quot; and being Latina, of being a high-achieving high schooler in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_placement" target="_blank">AP courses</a> with other Americans who are blind to her ethnicity and asked why &quot;they&quot; don't just go &quot;home&quot; and immigrate legally. At worst (and it's quite a short step in the case of illegal immigrants everywhere) she risks deportation with slim chances of return. At best, she can hope for sanctuary and some financial alleviation if the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAM_Act" target="_blank">Dream Act</a> passes.</p>
<p>Our instructor for the second workshop played this person's story as an example of digital storytelling. Several participants mentioned how uncomfortable the story made them feel, how her voice was trembling so much they thought she'd shatter into tears at any moment over her situation. They didn't know what to make of the story. Aside: I love awkward movies (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Squid_and_the_Whale" target="_blank">The Squid and the Whale</a> is a fantastic one), the tension around the white elephant in the room; I'm certain that awkwardness is an art itself in the art of film and acting. But that day in the second digital storytelling workshop, as I listened to the person's story again and heard the comments after, I realized that story holders have a power that storytellers do not. Because they're not ideas represented by actors and polished words, story holders have the power of truth in the voiceover room through the emotions they can't mask. It would be a shame if they could remove themselves.</p>

				<p>Work has been picking up. We are in an interesting phase for Vertical Response (thanks Matt G. for the recommendation). I applied for those 10,000 free monthly email blasts and we got a response rather quickly. That built some momentum at CCTPG California Community Technology Policy Group), because afterwards I worked on a layout for our newsletter. I've been working on our website's site map and wireframe using Microsoft Visio, ooooo. </p>
<p>Also, about three weeks ago, I was able to make it to an event put on by the Pat Brown Institute of Public Affairs. The topic for discussion was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBf4D7210pY" technology and the future of civic>“Technology and the Future of Civic Engagement.” </a> We met some interesting people at this event.</p>
<p>Webinars: I hope to apply to the Drupal and the website securities webinar from NTEN. I think today is the deadline to apply for IST funds for the Drupal webinar, because the webinar will be put on exactly 2 weeks from now.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to the CTCnet Conference and seeing as many CTC VISTAS as possible. The three CCTPG staff have signed up for the conference (including me). So I hope to see you all soon!</p>
<p>On other Non-related work issues: it seems like my foodstamps are on hold. But I will try to clear that up as soon as I can. This past weekend, my brother and I went to Mexicali, Mexico for <a href="http://www.fiestasdelsol.com.mx/" title="Las Fiestas del Sol">Las Fiestas del Sol</a> (it’s like a huge city fair). This means I have been able to save some money from my stipends (keep in mind I have no car and I live with 5 other people, jeje). So, I am thankful for CCTPG that they have been able to cover my transportation costs. I usually grocery shop after work or in the weekends, <em>todo a pie</em>.</p>
<p>One last fun one: Halloween costume: <a href="http://theluchadores.blogspot.com/2007/07/octagon.html" title="Octagon Mask">Octagon Mask</a> (only), which I bought while in Mexicali. Octagon was my favorite Mexican Luchador from the AAA league.</p>

	    <p>Hey Ed,</p>
<p>That's a kickass costume. I'm still trying to find the parts for my mad-scientist costume. I'm pretty good on the scientist part, but how to make it truly <em>mad</em>? There's a DrupalCon coming up in March that I'm going to post about. It's in D.C., but if your organization might sponsor you maybe you might want to go...?<br />

				<p>Things have been up and down, that why we're Rollin' on a river!<br />
Our kids just did a Health Rocks presentation at The YMCA. They did a great job! The kids were really responsive during the presentation. They did the one I like with the straws. Health Rocks is a presentation for 8-12 year olds done by kids around that age and older. It is lead by a teen (Yasmeen) who birthday was on the eighth of October she is wonderful and 17. (Happy Birthday Yaz!)  I am proud to work with this beautiful well rounded young woman who loves children and is a born leader.  She would work with children no matter what the circumstance. </p>
<p> We are presently working on a presentation for Health Rocks that we will be presenting at the Coastal Carolina Fair.  Ten kids will participate in this presentation. We have two kids who are creating a Folklore Project in honor of their mother who has passed away.  This project is a media project. Once they have completed it I will send you guys a copy of it. We will also have an art exhibit one of our students is drawing.  We will also being doing a cooking presentation. They will be cooking no bake cookies. Our second and third graders will make that presentation. Yasmeen is the super teen leader supervisor who keeps me grounded. Keeps me forever pushing on!</p>
<p>Last month we trained a group of middle school teens to become mentors. Our training lasted three weeks. It covered documentation, communicating with your teen leader and communicating with the kids, positive reinforcement for good behavior and a point system for those who are hard cases.  We also talked about maintaining your grades while helping others.  We created a time for our youth leaders to work on their own projects after the kids have been served. The final portion of the training was working on a service project. So far the trainees are doing okay with the kids. We have had no major catastrophes. Yasmeen and I revamped the whole system. Volunteers will have more support because of what we changed.</p>
<p>We have financial challenges at this time. We continue to push forward.  We have a website that you can donate on.  We are working on some creative ways for fundraising.<br />
The links are below.    <a href="http://cash.zeropricetags.com/?REF=55870" title="http://cash.zeropricetags.com/?REF=55870">http://cash.zeropricetags.com/?REF=55870</a>  </p>

<p>I have been working on collaboration with the Art Institute in Charleston to host a graphic arts class for our kids.  I am hoping that the program will be ongoing as the Art Institute offers a host of other programs that our kids would be interested. We are in the beginning stages of this project. We are also working on a mentorship program with Clemson finding mentors for kids whose parent or parents are prisoners.  Building Dreams is the name of that program.</p>
<p>Well that all for now.....Bye<br />

				<p>This was a really great week... I got engaged and turned 22 all in a period of 24 hours!  Woot!  So, my boyfriend and I went out to dinner the night before my birthday because the next night we were going out with all of our friends.  We went to a fancy restaurant, which is something that we do maybe twice a year.  Anywho, we had a a discount, so we decided to use it.  After that, we were going to watch a movie outside on the state capitol lawn.  (This is something that we do once a year when the weather gets a little cooler, and where we first indirectly hung out with each other while playing freeze tag)  So, we get to the gate, and there is a card with a rose.  Then he leads me to the next card, and the next, and the next.  After I read the last card, I knew what he was up to and when I turned around he was on his knee.  I said yes, and then he called to our friends to come out from hiding behind on of the many statues.  They had set up a video camera, ipod, roses, letters, and champagne bottle all while we were at dinner.  So, we all went down to our favorite martini bar and had the "Wedding Cake" martini.  Luckily, it was happy hour all night long and the $11 martinis were only $5!  So, after about 26 martinis between our closest friends, we went home engaged!</p>
<p>The next morning, I woke up and turned 22!</p>
<p>When it comes to the Mobile Film School, things have been a bit slow.  We are hopefully going to launch our new website tomorrow, thus creating more work for me.  Other than that, I've worked on graphics that I hope are implemented into the site and redesigned a few documents.  I do have a bit of trouble with the slower pace because as a student I always had at least a couple of part-time jobs going on during school.  But, our first student workshop is coming up in November, so I'm hoping that will pick up the pace. Not to mention, I get to photograph it!  Yay!</p>
<p>The other worry has been IST funds.  In such a small business things like that seemed to get pushed to the side a lot.  So, today I sent off an email with two ways the funds could be allocated, and hopefully this time they will approve it.  I'll be very disappointed if I don't get to use my training funds because of the slow pace of approval.  </p>
<p>'till next time!</p>

				<p>Laura has inspired me, and it's a slow day in the office, so it's field report time!</p>
<p>Last night I was tapped (by process of elimination) to give a presentation on Digital Storytelling to the East Bay Mac Users Group at Ex'Pressions in Emeryville. I spoke for an hour, running through the history of CDS, an overview of the workshop process (including a writing exercise) and of course I showed some digital stories. All in all, I think it went really well, and we might even get a few volunteers out of it!</p>
<p>Next week starts the onslaught of workshops: a 3 day general at the end of next week, a 5 Day TTT the week after that, then hopefully Chicago for the open workshop in mid-November, then my and Laura's KPFA workshop the first week of December. I'm excited about it, but also nervous. We did a tutorial run-through with Andrea a week or two ago, and that combined with my presentation last night has made me feel better about doing a workshop, but there's still so much to learn. </p>
<p>Laura and I are also working on the CDS archive, which you can read about in her blog  <a href="http://ctcvista.org/node/1356">here</a>. Also, I got the intern, Zoe, to fall for the updog AGAIN. Exciting stuff!</p>
<p>Also, on a more personal note, I bought a TiVo. If you've been thinking about it, do it, friends. It will change your life.</p>
<p>Have a fantastic weekend!</p>

	    <p>Totally smells like updawg in here.  Awesome to connect with the East Bay MUG at Ex'Pressions.  Great context for meeting with a pertinent group for a cool topic - I'd imagine they might make some tech-saavy/tech-passionate volunteers/storytellers.  Awesome to have the writing exercise there too.  Link?  </p>
<p>What's TTT?  Other folks might not know about that model or how it relates to capacity-building...  </p>

<p>P.S. hilARIOUS on the updawg.</p>

				<p>Have any of you read <a href="http://www.qwantz.com">Dinosaur Comics</a>? I'm not totally in love with it, but sometimes it includes very perceptive insights. It's a daily webcomic that uses the same six frames of a goofy looking dinosaur every day to tell strange and goofy stories. The other day it ended with T-Rex saying "Um, I'm thinking... that a lot of my internal conflict and malaise comes from the tension between the life I ACTUALLY want to live, and the stories I want to be able to tell?" I've been thinking about that a lot lately.</p>
<p>I should say, before going any further, that I'm really happy with my life right now. I love working with the OLLIE program. I had a moment a couple weeks ago where I was setting up for a class and thought "Is this really my job? I don't have to go back to nannying next week?" I feel this way all the time- just so privileged to be part of this awesome program, doing such awesome things. I'm taking Spanish classes, I've visited the KBOO Youth Collective a couple of times to learn more about how their program runs, I meet awesome kids and teach them awesome things. This is the first job I've ever had where I don't feel like anyone is questioning my intelligence or my ability. I can do this and I'm good at it! And I think I'm getting better every day.</p>
<p>But back to that dinosaur comic. Last night I talked to my best friend. She has lived a very adventurous life since we graduated college. Her primary jobs have been working as a pedicab driver and operating a puppet show on a bike. She's in several bands, went to Morocco last year, and just came back from a tour of England. I love her to death, and at time find myself very jealous of the excitement she fills her life with. I want to be able to tell stories about sailing up Lake Michigan on a tall ship, too! Or do I? Because, ultimately, I think I prefer this quiet existence I have carved out for myself. I want to be able to tell those stories, but I think this is really the kind of life I want to live.</p>
<p>When I started back in July, I was really worried about having enough personal time. It's somewhat of an issue, but in a lot of ways, something I've always suspected has proved true: Having a job I like and care about takes away the need to fill my life with other things. I've spent the previous four years working jobs that I don't care about to get by, and so I squeezed the most fun and enjoyment I could out of my free time, making art, dancing, and hanging out with my friends. It's not that I've stopped doing these things, but I certainly don't have as much time for it now... But I don't miss it too much. Life is good.</p>
<p>In other news, I just order three new pairs of glasses from <a href="http://www.zennioptical.com">Zenni Optical</a>. You can get a pair for as cheap as $8! If you are an eyeglass wearer and have your prescription, this is a great deal. Especially since Americorps don't get vision insurance.</p>

this is an awesome post.  I've had some of the same tension sometimes with my own work.  I used to dj a lot more, promote parties and chase all kinds of wonderful dreams (which I still do occasionally;).</p>
<p>I have a friend who sold his Vespa and vintage guitar to play accordian in a punk band while squatting and busking in Europe.  He ended up getting appropriated by another hardcore band (who also wanted him to play in their band), but just ended up driving the Volkswagen bus for them through all kinds of countryside, festivals etc.</p>
<p>He's also now totally brilliant, life-experienced, but without much of an established professional network or much professional experience towards more higher paying jobs (at least the last time we talked).</p>
<p>I didn't have any of those kinds of experiences - stumbling through streets drunken in the morning, backpacking through foreign countries picking grapes in a French vineyard..., but I do have a network and security that I wouldn't have otherwise had, had I not committed to being a VISTA and working as much as I had.  I feel like if ever I were to lose my job or switch jobs, it wouldn't be so traumatic/hard as it has been in the past.</p>
<p>I myself have always had a tension between my creative aspirations and my desire to affect change in the world (done through professional work).  Finding an org (CTC VISTA) that supports both in some manner has been a wonderful stroke of luck.  I certainly don't say that because I'm a VISTA Leader either, I say it because it's just been damn cool, hard and fun.</p>
<p>Good post.</p>

	    <p>Hey Nickey,</p>
<p>Yeah, I often feel like I'm not having enough adventures, though maybe not so much anymore (for much the same reasons as you, since now I have a job(s) full of good stuff). I always wanted to do the kind of work I'm doing now, but it's not the kind of thing you can generally make a living with. Or at least, you can't just go out and apply for a job being an anarchist hacker for social justice. But VISTA has given me an opportunity to do that for a while, and now after I leave I'll have the connections and know-how and reputation to be able to keep doing cool stuff, rather than getting a stapler and going all Office Space, which seems to be the fate of many techies.</p>
<p>But DINOSAUR COMICS! Possibly my favorite thing of all time. It is uncanny how often I am thinking of something, just like you were, no matter how esoteric, and I read Dinosaur Comics and that's what the comic is about, even if it's something like "Utilitarianism." I think Ryan North must have a direct connection into the brains of everyone and everything cool.</p>
<p>Good call on Zenni, I'm going to order some glasses from there. My glasses recently broke after only having them for a few months, though to be fair they were cheap-but-awesome reading glasses that I picked up in a thrift store and got fitted with regular lenses, rather than being normal frames. The local optometrists suck, so that seems like a great option. Are you coming to CTCnet?<br />

	    <p>Hi Nickey,</p>
<p>I'm a new VISTA working out in NYC, and I read this post whenever it was made public last year and really identified with it. As the other commenters have said, I totally get what you're saying and ditto it. I also have found that in my almost two weeks of working this VISTA position that some of this tension, at least, is subsiding - I'm really able to do the things I want to be doing here, and it's making life a lot easier for me. I still have a lot of wanderlust and fantasies of heading off for the forest or exploring - but I get the feeling that this work will make those opportunities even more possible for me. Of course, I'm still in the bright eyed and bushy tailed stage.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for writing, and I'm glad to see you'll be serving another year - I've heard excellent things about Reel Girls.</p>
