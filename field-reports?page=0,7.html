				<p>Lately, here in San Francisco, we here at <a href="http://aspirationtech.org">Aspiration</a> have been working with a bunch of hardware donations, building the content for our <a href="http://answr.net">ANSWR</a> website and doing the usual <a href="http://socialsourcecommons.org">Social Source Commons</a> maintenance and managing.  It's been pretty engaging though because I'm learning about building a website with a content management system (<a href="http://socialsourcecommons.org/tool/show/96/">Joomla</a>) as well as how the hell to upkeep it once you do.  So my FTP client (<a href="http://socialsourcecommons.org/tool/show/186/">Cyberduck</a>) has become my best friend.  On January 30th, we had an Aspiration "retreat" where we basically mapped out the major events, goals and whatnot for the coming year or at least for the next couple of quarters.  (Everyone around here talks about Q1 and Q2 and it just sounds like Dr. Seuss to me)  The retreat was extremely helpful for me and I only wish that it was doable to have them more often.  It's amazing how much more on point I am with my work when there's an over-arching timeline and guide for what it is I'm doing.  I mean, even though <a href="http://socialsourcecommons.org/tool/show/77/">Basecamp</a> can be a pain in my ass, I do really appreciate the organization aspect for work.  </p>
<p>Can I just take this middle paragraph and lend a shout out to <a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/">FLOSS Manuals</a>?  They're a great organization headed by my kiwi friend Adam (or EE-dum as he would say) focused on documentation in this crazy software world.  They have a system where you can super easily create a manual for any type of software using a wiki system, because let's face it, nobody likes to be the guy writing the user manual.  They have a bunch of manuals on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Open Source</a> software tools and recently put together a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOSS">FLOSS</a> version of <a href="http://wiki.digital-foundations.net/index.php?title=Main_Page">"Digital Foundations"</a> (a kind of bible apparently in the graphic design world that focuses on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Creative_Suite">Adobe CS</a>) where they took the exercises and design lessons and adapted them for use with FLOSS tools like <a href="http://socialsourcecommons.org/tool/show/131/">Gimp</a> and <a href="http://socialsourcecommons.org/tool/show/197/">Inkscape</a>.  And the PDF versions of the manuals are always free, so if you're ever in need of some graphic design skills but can't afford the mega expensive Adobe products, check out some open source lovin!  </p>
<p>Other than working, I moved into a new place right next to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=mission+dolores+park,+sf,+ca&amp;jsv=145d&amp;sll=37.757517,-122.421813&amp;sspn=0.017881,0.038624&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;latlng=37759780,-122426010,5102463850241558545&amp;ei=NP2iSdH5I47CNd3quPgP&amp;sig2=tJoTBxDq0dayv0pVrZAIhw&amp;cd=1">Dolores Park</a> which is pretty sweet.  My roomies run a nonprofit and were pretty much drooling about the fact that I could help them with tech stuff.  Also, I'm mildly freaking out about finding a job when this whole Americorps gig wraps.  Everybody and their mother is giving me job advice which is super welcome but now I have to put it into practice.  I need to work on my resume, cover letters, LinkedIn profile...  We'll see what happens, but for now I'm just trying to figure out how to make an RSS feed a Joomla Page.  Eh.</p>

				<p>Hey there good looking people of the Americorps world,</p>
<p>It's been awhile as I have been busier than ever. ZUMIX started construction on a firehouse that should be completed in the next 8 months or so. This means ZUMIX will be moving into a bigger and more state-of-the-art facility. Unfortunately, I will not be serving anymore by the time this transition takes place. While it saddens me that I will not be a part of the new ZUMIX, I also feel lucky to be a part of ZUMIX just the way it is now. Expansion can only mean kids getting less individual attention in group programs, more of a disconnect among the administration that does not work in the same "department" and an increasing sense of bureaucracy that is essential to maintain organization but unfortunately also creates more of a disconnect between staff and participants. </p>
<p>In lieu of this future move, I have been asked to take on a large new project involving a survey of ZUMIX participants pertaining to the type of communication they use most frequently. With this, we are hoping to rally kids for events with less stress and better turnout. Especially considering the larger space we are about to have, we don't want kids to not hear about events going on ZUMIX-related or not. There's no reason for them not to know! I have attached the survey and would love some feedback! My first experiment is with myspace which you can also feel free to give me feedback for. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/zumixrules" title="http://www.myspace.com/zumixrules">http://www.myspace.com/zumixrules</a></p>
<p>Part of my duties here are maintaining the youtube which I just updated with a performance from a guest artist named Mr. Napkins we had here last week. He is a comedian/hip hop artist and did a rhyme-writing workshop with everyone. SUPER FUN! Check it out!!</p>

				<p>We are working feverishly on our fundraiser for the continuation of the programs for the Ardmore/Sherwood Forest community.  PINK HOUSE kids have joined us and they have decided that they will not go down without a fight. We are presently working on our raffle. We will be raffling off grocery, a gas card and gift card worth twenty-five dollars. The prizes came  as a donations from one of the local small business. They promised two-hundred dollars. The kids will be making the pictures for the raffle tickets and the tickets for  the dinner. </p>
<p>We will also collaborate with a group called Carolina Studios. The programs combines computers with producing and making rap music . The PINK HOUSE kids presented Health Rocks to the students who attend the studio and now these kids want to start there own 4H club and join in on spreading the message that it's not cool for kids to smoke, or drink alcohol or do drugs. They were very impressed by our team (who by the way are younger than them.) The PINK HOUSE kids will be going to the studio to lay down some tracks as they say in the music business. </p>
<p>Well the dinner is suppose to be March 21, 2009 but we still don't have a location to have the dinner yet. We have  almost completed choosing programs for the summer. I think we should carry on in a positive mode  like we have the money already and be prepared for when God throws in the funds we need.<br />
I would like for everything to be set  before the summer comes in. I would also like to have the fall programming set as well. Well that's all for now.</p>

				<p>Hi Everyone,  </p>
<p>    Seems like I don't have enough hours in a day to do all I need to do lately. It has been extremely busy over here. I am currently working on tracking the work history and wage history of people after they return to the work force. Does anyone know of any freeware form filler case management software I can get a hold of?<br />
     I have been learning a lot about social security disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income(SSI) and how to help a disabled or misplaced worker back into the work force and still trying to keep their heads above water financially. It’s worse now than ever before with the job market being as bad as it is. I am currently developing my own data base for keeping track of consumers but its so time consuming so if any one out there can help me please let me know. I am always happy when I place someone in a job, and they like what they are doing, that is most rewarding.<br />
      I really am worried about employers that are not willing to hire the disabled; for fear that they may have to be involved with them. Since the last time I reported I have placed at least 3 people in jobs that they have so far stayed with. I see that there are a lot of good things going on all over so keep up the good work all</p>
<p> See you next month.</p>
<p>Donna</p>

				<p>This morning I walked into the gallery and saw the new exhibition for the first time. It's called The Space Between The Pit and The Peak, Incarnate Two. It was put together by Lillian Harden and curated by our own Setheyny Pen, and it's simply.... well... fabulous... </p>
<p>It's a multimedia installation meant to challenge the way we think about human interaction. Among several other pieces, there's a life sized sculpture of a person, its over sized head slumping onto the floor. Next to that is a two bodied baby. On the other side of a partition a figure lies hidden under black velvet in front of a wooden television. </p>
<p>On the far wall a video plays in an endless loop. It's three of the sculptures, each toiling under the pressure of some unseen inner conflict. They interact with each other on occasion, but for the most part all seem lost in their own world. </p>
<p>"I'm hoping that [the audience] will be thinking about themselves and their relationships," said Lillian in a phone interview last week, "I want them to have an otherworldly experience. It's going to really encompass the senses. It's got sounds, the lights will be dimmed and there will be little mirrors and lights. It's going to definitely have a theatrical element. It's a slightly allegorical other world." </p>
<p>Everyone around here is very excited about the show and even more excited about all of the great press and events we have been having.</p>
<p>Tonight we will be hosting the first monthly installment of Artbeat. The hip hop event will feature an open table format- giving anybody who's brought needles and records a chance to sign up and spin a set. In case that isn't enough, there will also be some live art, a VJ, and breakdancers. How much for all this, you ask? Nothing. That's right. It's free. </p>
<p>This Valentine's Day we will hold our second Dinner &amp; A Movie. We want to keep things spicy by serving up some delicious Indian food made by RebelChef Y Woodward. We're also bringing in the world jazz of Spiral7 (complete with sitar). After that we'll be screening a sultry Bollywood classic film. Should be a good night. </p>
<p>We've got a ton of other things planned too, but if I go on anymore about them this might start to sound waaaaay too much like a commercial. I guess I am in charge of marketing, but I'm sure it's starting to get obnoxious. Haha. </p>
<p>For now, I'm just trying to keep up. I just signed on to be a correspondent for the Boston Cyber Arts Festival which will be great, because I'm itching to do some reporting. It's been WAY too long. I'm also on the planning committee for this year's NAMAC conference in Boston (National Alliance For Media Arts and Culture) and am organizing (and acting in ) next month's production of The Vagina Monologues (I'm doing the "Reclaiming Cunt" monologue. I can't wait). To top it off, I'm about to be promoted to assistant director and have yet to start writing my "how-to" manuals for marketing. </p>
<p>As you all probably know, my contract here is up in July, and that seems right around the corner. Nate and I will be road tripping it back to Oregon, heading south and then west. After that it's Maui and then Central America for some nice chill out time on the Caribbean. I've got a writing job lined up that will pay nicely while I sip aguardiente and mescal on the beach. And after this winter you know I'm going to need that. I'm a tropical girl at heart. This place is a tad on the chilly side for me.  I've got a few people along the way that I'm long overdue in visiting. Now I just need to find a car... Any ideas?</p>

				<p>One of the main goals for HOME In.c at the moment is to create a community between the students in our different programs (our three partner schools and the TeenTV summer workshop).  I feel that the best way to do this is to tap into existing social network rather than trying to create our own.  We've tried having a Myspace page for TeenTV but it hasn't caught on.  Currently I'm looking into developing a presence on Facebook...creating group pages for TeenTV and each media lab.  I'd like to have each media lab have it's own group that is affiliated and shares membership with the main TeenTV group.  Hopefully in this way students from different schools can network with one another.</p>
<p>I'm also developing some curriculum materials around blogging and citizen journalism.  Working with a journalism class, the stories published in the school newspaper will also be published on the web via a blog, with some stories being developed into video pieces for the school TV show.  Ideally the school's paper (The Brighton Banner) will have an online audience that will enage with one another and the authors discussing the articles and issues within the school and the community.</p>

				<p>All of us at Project HQ are ramping up for our recruiting round this Summer.  We've already made some changes in our guidelines and priorities for organizations, and we'll be rolling out some improved process for potential VISTA members to sign-up.  As part of the changes, we're going through a strategic planning and branding process.  It's taking its sweet time, but part of that process is reapproaching the Mission, Vision, Values of our organization.  </p>
<p>I wanted to post our initial draft of our Values.  To help explain how we got to this point, we went through a consensus building activity---basically what we did at CTCnet, if you attended.  All of us staff at HQ (Belinda, Jules and I) wrote down, each idea on a tacky note, what we <em>value</em>.  Then we each stuck our notes on a wall.  Then we went around and grouped two notes together, and then grouped those groups until we had 4 main groups.  Then we tried to come up with a label for each group. </p>
<p>I want to explain the process since it produces some interesting results: at the beginning of the process, none of these end-values were exactly what we wrote down, but once we synthesized and synergized, this is what we got:</p>
<p><strong><em>We Value:</em></strong><br />
<strong>Service</strong>: Working with one to benefit many for understanding and advancing a movement.</p>
<p><strong>Ecologies</strong>: Mindful of cause and effect on a path to an improved state of being.</p>
<p><strong>Space</strong>: Providing resources, opportunities, and context to spur new ideas and actions.</p>
<p><strong>Networks</strong>: Amplifying the power of communications</p>
<p>We'd love to hear your feedback on these.  Some of them are a little <em>whah?!</em>, but that's the sort of thing that comes out of the process---believe me, no one was remotely thinking "ecologies" coming into it.</p>

				<p>Hello everyone,<br />
     I hope every thing are going well. For this report I have some the same entries as before, with a new twist. We started the new nine week training classes, Introduction to Computers, Microsoft Word, and Microsoft Excel. I started teaching the Word class February 4, 2009, since I could find no one else and I do have Microsoft Certification in Word. At this time, I have two students but I am hoping for more this week since we are getting over the past inauguration week. The Microsoft Excel class fared much better, that class had nine new students (great!).<br />
     Another project started, the twist, I have been in negotiation with Lisa McQuail of Technologist inc. and Father Jean Claude Atusameso of the Jatukik Foundation in an effort to get the Community for Creative Non-Violence's old Arts and Education building renovated.<br />
     Lisa, myself, and Father Jean Claude meet every Wednesday at 3:00 pm. Since our last meeting, I have taken pictures of the interior and exterior of the building and e-mailed them to Lisa. She in turn has given the photo to Peter Wehmann the Business Development Manager and Bob Arguero a Senior Engineer and Director of Business at Technologists inc. This was done so they would have an idea of the size and the condition of the space. Bob Arguero has worked with renewable energy and energy-efficient building materials with the US Department of Energy. The idea is to turn the building into a model “Green Project.”<br />
     I have emailed Tommy Wells of the city council and Congresswoman Elenor Holmes Norton in an effort to make them aware of this "Green Project."<br />
Finally, we have set up a meeting for March 25, for city council member Tommy Wells, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes-Norton and other important city officials, to discuss if there is a possibility of them being a part of the project. I am also attaching a front and rear view of the building.</p>

				<p>Well finishing up with the 100 second film festival is relieving, i found that all I wanted to do is just get it over with towards the end.  I am currrently working with numerous non- profits and schools,  setting up little feild production groups. I'd say in all we have got about five diff. groups of at least 4 students, and its working out great.    On february 10th we have got an event called artbeat, which is a hip hop show, for teens i guesss, about every other tuesday of the month. Mira is also working on that, it is going to be at the 119.<br />
             But nonethe less working in these groups have been a good experience on myself and on ltc, lately ltc has been a little hectic and when theres a big group of kids it kinda gets everyone moving and talking.<br />
             Still trying to adjust with the whole vista thing,   I get fr4ustrated sometimes but then i remember its only till July.<br />
   You should check out 100seconds.org. it's is a real dish.<br />
             Pretty soon the winterfest is coming, and let me tell you that it is freezing. but fun,  just carry around a couple nips in your back pocket. not on the job of course, and you'll be all set.  Talk to you soon.<br />

				<p>I have been working on putting the MicroMentor Marketing Plan into action. And, as part of the new year requested more clear definition of my role at MicroMentor. We listed our program at the inauguration site and the MLK site in relation to the president’s Day of Service. And in February we’ll be conducting a couple of marketing campaigns related to Black History Month and Entrepreneurship Week. I’m in the process of creating a Facebook page and building out our Linkedin group. </p>
<p>Gathering and recognizing marketing opportunities and identifying resources to act on them have been problematic in the past. So, on the capacity building front, I am organizing our marketing efforts into projects and have just installed the project management tool DreamTeam  (plus a Google adwords and Calendar Timeline tools) in order to get our tools under one roof in Saleforce. Nonprofits can get up to ten copies of DreamTeam for free. (Kudos to Matt’s org <a href="http://www.socialsourcecommons.org" title="www.socialsourcecommons.org">www.socialsourcecommons.org</a> which shares information about nonprofit tools, I used his site to research project management tools. DreamTeam doesn’t exactly advertise the 10 free licenses – so without SSC I probably wouldn’t have considered it.) Would appreciate advice, if anyone is a current DreamTeam user. Thanks.</p>
<p>Hopefully the organization will want to use project management tools and methods for other projects (aside from marketing); and after I leave they’ll have project management tools/methods in place for the future. (But I have not convinced anyone – yet – to embrace Gantt charts. I love them and will keep pushing :) I’m leading a weekly marketing meeting to report on projects/campaigns as well as our latest analytics and to get input from everyone about marketing opportunities. </p>
<p>Will, I know how you feel RE: travel in Washington state. My children were stuck in Bellingham for the holidays, no cars moving safely and not even Amtrak was running. We finally got to celebrate Christmas with them last week, which was great. Except now I really have no good excuse for not taking down the Christmas tree. I hope everyone is off to a good start in the new year.<br />

Our organization's responsibilities included taking in applications for those interested in the program, reviewing the applications to make sure they meet the requirements, running workshops teaching the Chinatown community about energy efficiency and then giving each household that participated 20 light bulbs. Overall, the program has raised over $22,000. The final count on applications was 1124. </p>
<p>There have been many, many bumps in the road. I'm sure Katrina knows how the Chinese ladies in the neighborhood act, it's overwhelming and sometimes they can be rude. I've had to deal with yelling old Chinese ladies that push and shove, they refuse to listen to me sometimes because I cannot speak Chinese, so they ignore me. It's been a battle man! There are also those couple of old ladies that I've had great conversations with, it's nice to get to know the community through the various workshops we have had. </p>
<p>We have run 60 workshops, I  have two volunteers that are very dedicated to the program, they come in every workshop and present it to the participants. This program has helped learn and grow in so many ways. I didn't have much support when it came to running the program, so things got really crazy because I am so inexperienced in being strategic and managing a program. I am so glad to have been able to have the chance to work on something that has helped me grow so much professionally.</p>
<p>Second, the youth. They have been awesome we accepted a new bunch of youth this past January. We are in the process of putting them through their initial 10-week training. The old youth are now putting together a CD that they want to release at their event in April called Breaking the Barriers. We received a grant to put on the second annual Breaking the Barriers event, it's basically an open mic event that youth can participate in to get their voices out. The old youth are also still holding the radio show down every Saturday, and although walking tours have minimal during the winter it should pick up again this spring and summer when the weather gets better. </p>
<p>I was actually warned by the previous youth programs manager that the youth would eventually take over my life, and it's slowing becoming true. The youth are awesome, sometimes when I get really frustrated and wonder what I'm doing it just really takes one youth to make me realize that this is all worth it.</p>
<p>Third, social media. I have started to activate some social media accounts for ACDC. I've created many many social media sites for both A-VOYCE and ACDC already, but now I'm starting to indulge myself in it. I've been to a couple of seminars about social media and HOW to use it. We're starting to do many new and cool things here.</p>
<p>Lastly, LOVETA IN LOS ANGELES. Loveta was a riot in L.A. We were at the CTCNet conference in November. It was sort of a crappy conference but Loveta kept me entertained most of the time. I had fun. </p>
<p>Until next time, </p>

				<p>While I'm still in the process of updating the service listings in the database, I had a 2-week respite from that, creating reports from the case management system.  The fun part was using Crystal Reports to create the reports.  The process involved downloading data from the system into Excel worksheets, then overlaying the spreadsheet with Crystal Reports. </p>
<p> This reporting method was vastly different from the reporting I had done in the past while a consultant -- in those days I used a DBMS language with reporting and procedural capability called Nomad.  Crystal Reports is a GUI-based software that can be used for nearly every major ODBC database as well as Excel.  The reports involved demographic data and case management system usage.</p>
<p>Note: Crystal Reports costs approximately $75 for a non-profit and is available from Tech Soup (or at least is was about a year or so ago).</p>

				<p>this is my first field report. i hate that i have not been involved our engaged this conversation for the last six months but i look forward to the opportunity to be engaged in this conversation for the continuation of my vista service. i look forward to reading about everyone's journey. there's a lot to catch up on related to my service. i'll give you the short and sweet version first to create some context for future reports.</p>
<p><strong>what's familiar?</strong> who am i being? </p>
<p>open media project. i'm the project manager for the beta test implementation of the open media project tool set. the open media project is an iniative to create a tool set based on open source technologies that allow peg stations and ctcs work a nationwide, user-driven network. </p>
<p>colorado youth at risk. i'm a mentor with colorado youth at risk. colorado youth at risk is an intensive high school drop out prevention program. the program provides mentee with an interested adult and a sense of their place in the future.</p>
<p>vlogtv. i'm the co-host of live, call-in show on denver open media. vlogtv is all about viewers requesting their favorite online videos. there's only one rule, we don't show copy written material. </p>
<p>landmark education. i'm currently participating in a landmark seminar after completing the landmark forum. landmark education is training and development center that provides individuals access to effective action in everyday matters. </p>
<p><strong>what's happening?</strong> what's challenges am i facing?</p>
<p>life as a vista. vista life is no longer glamorous. when i first became a vista, i loved gloating to people about my altruistic service asan americorps volunteer.  those days are over. now, when i tell people i'm an americorps vista there's a  part of me that wants to ask for spare change at the same time. my savings are exhausted. i'm operating without a budget. </p>
<p>personal integrity. my participation with landmark education has shown me that i have lacked personal integrity in the past. it has also shown me that i don't need to continue to carry that lack of integrity into the present and furture. i see that at every moment i have the opportunity to completed transform and become a personal of complete integrity. you'll be hearing about this a lot more, trust me. </p>
<p>understanding before being understood. my vista service has given me the opportunity to see that in order to interact effectively with others, i must first understand others. i still fight to be understood in a world i want to understand. </p>
<p><strong>what's possible?</strong> what am i committed to?</p>
<p>i am committed to: </p>
<ul>
<li>continued sharing via field reports. </li>
<li>creating the world i want to live in. </li>
<li>enjoying life as a non-smoker. </li>
<li>creating and maintaining a budget. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>resources.</strong> what do i have to share? </p>
<p>i didn't being this report ready to provide resources. i am committed to sharing resources in future reports.</p>

				<p>Happy New Year Everybody!</p>
<p>I havent been writing anything in a long time but I have been very busy!!  I find what I do and the people I collaborate with, especially the young people a very rewarding experience and with the excitement that President Obama is creating with emphasis on volunteering and community involvement, I am truly looking forward to great things happening this year!</p>
<p>I have been involved in exciting collaborative opportunities.  All have been awesome, The Community Place: Youth/Adult Partnership -- youth and adults working together to develop and implement programs for youth in the community. The youth involved were involved in a program called Asset Mapping in which they were taught to use computer software and hand held palm tech equipment to collect data of the Northeast Area such as what interests and hobbys people in the neighborhood have that they would like to share with others?  This information along with what businesses are in the area or other data was used in setting up a database that people in the community who are looking for volunteers  can access.<br />
My most passionate collaborative is with WXXI, PBS affiliate, who have a filmmakers program, Raising 100,000 Voices.  This is the third year we have been a part of this program.  Its empasis is on Digital Storytelling which was a plus for me.  The youth are responsible for making a 3 minute film.  When we first start with them, I said to myself, " Oh that will be a piece of cake".  What a challenge this project was!  I had had experiece in editing,etc. but we used new software, cameras, and the youth had to learn so many different aspects of film making.  They have workshops for them to give assistance with the pre production,and so on. (We just had the Kick-off January 19th) We have 2 more workings to attend and then we turn in our films April 23rd.  If you are intested in looking at films that were done by the youth including ours your can go to the website, wxxi.org and click on raising 100,000 voices. The website will give you more information on the program and we are under Teens Advocating Nonviolence at Parsells Avenue Community Church.  There are alot of great films!  In May, they do a really nice Oscar Night type of event to showcase the films so that people in the community as well as family members can get a chance to see the films also.  </p>
<p>I have also been working on a program, The Urban Youth Arts and Film Academy which is a component of a program I developed called The Dream Makers Program. (if you would like more information on that program and the full curriculums please let me know).  I am very excited about the workshops and trainings such as workshop on storytelling as an art form by a professional storyteller, Almita Whitis, who is known locally, nationally and internationally, Digial photography and others.  The computer center is in the process of being renovated and with the help of the youth and adult volunteers, transformed into a state of the art technology center!  </p>
<p>We have a good relationship with many agencies and organizations that I have not mentioned and we continue to support their efforts as they do ours.  Well everyone nice talking to you and I will give you more updates soon!<br />
See ya,<br />
Doreen</p>

			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p>The last paragraph of my previous field report stated, "I've started looking into tools and procedures to improve the project management and timekeeping for the organization".  In this search I (we) have settled on a tool written in Rails, called "Clocking IT".  I guess the IT stands for information technology, however; the tool seems to me suitable for logging time on all kinds of tasks.  The developer, one Erlend Simonsen, has generously made this code available to the public in two crucial ways.  He offers the source code, and he also is running a public server where anyone can try out the tool before taking the effort to install and configure their own installation of it from the source.  And indeed my org is already relying heavily on this tool and using it on the public server.  I am now engaged in setting up our own installation so we shan't have to depend on the public one staying up.  It is necessary to load the version corresponding to the data schema of our data (which, fortunately, we should be able to save from the public server; there is a pushbutton for that purpose).</p>
<p>On another subject, I attended a very interesting presentation, interesting, that is, to those who recommend a Content Management System (CMS) to their clients.  A company called Browser something is coming out on February the 7th with a beta version of their new CMS to be open-sourced, Browser CMS, running on Rails.  I have recommended to my org to take a good look at it to possibly replace the general-purpose CMS developed here.  From the presentation it seems to me that the software architecture is good.  I think there is hope that this product will nucleate a real community effort in maintaining in Rails a good CMS suitable for nontechnical editors; it should be easier to use than Drupal for example.  I hope the community effort will make the effort less for each organization than would occur if each org maintained their own CMS.</p>
<p>Once or twice, my experience with Unix-like systems has come in handy for informing my colleague/boss here about the permission system as he has run into problems the solving of which depended on that kind of knowledge.</p>
<p>Let's see, the CTC VISTA web server says I submitted my last field retort 5 weeks 23 hours ago; what date does that make it?  About Dec. 23?  That can't be right, because I wasn't working that week.  Must have been be more like the 16th.</p>
<p>I spent a few hours explaining things to a new volunteer who may become proficient in Rails.  I also helped two other volunteers get started working on financial aspects for the org.  I brought  up a development environment on my home computer.  I use Google spreadsheets to keep track of the steps involved in setting up servers as for development or production (the needs for development and production being similar).</p>
<p>Before settling on Clocking IT as the tool for time tracking, I wasted significant time investigating alternatives and even trying to develop one from scratch.</p>

				<p>Well since I summed up mu final words and thoughts in my last post, all I can say is that it's been a pleasure. Though tomorrow is my last official day, it's brought a bit of piece of mind to my former students and boss to know that I'll still visit from time to time and pitch in when I can. I truly believed in the work I was doing for The Media Aid Center and saw positive effects the lives in contact with our program. I know that no matter where I am or what organization I go on to represent, I'll always be a staff member of the Media Aid Center.

				<p>Honestly, in July, I had no idea of the concept of “building capacity”. But today I am getting to see some results.  All it took was almost blinded diligent work in the first couple of months as a VISTA.  It began with surveying email news blast tools (I know it’s very low tech work) and finally choosing Constant Contact (sorry VR peeps).  In December, I set up workshops for the assistant staff at Community Partners so that they could get familiar with the tool.  Then I “prairie dogged” (as one staff member puts it) around to see if any of them needed any help.  Then first week of January came and the assistant staff was set with a new task: get the word out to our constituents that our CEO/President will be speaking at an evening event.  They use the tool and skills they built to email blast our constituents and as a result, the event was completely booked.  This has never happened to the third party entity who was organizing this event!  </p>
<p>Currently I am working on managing CCTPG’s database by tidying it up. Last month, I created my <a href="http://media.switchpod.com//users/cctpg/CTCNetMainPodcast4.mp3" title="first podcast">first podcast </a>(the very famous Dan Strangl is in it); I hope to improve significantly on this new acquired skill (especially on my reporting voice).  I hope to do more of these audio podcast and get involved with video podcast, that way I can build more capacity by helping our Communications Team create their own. </p>
<p>In terms of policy, we are involved in the <a href="http://internetforeveryone.org/" title="Internet for Everyone campaign">Internet for Everyone campaign</a> and the Digital Inclusion strategy for the City of Los Angeles.  These are both very exciting policy issues that I hope to get more involved in.</p>
<p>Half way to the end of this program, I am feeling good about the energy I have placed in this organization. Happy New Years, Happy Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and Happy Obama’s Inauguration Day!</p>

				<p>Alas, the robots got me again. </p>
<p>Things slowed down a bit for the winter break. We got a week off which was really nice. It was my first legit vacation in a long time and I used the time to chill with family, eat a bunch, and get some rest. The break was a good point to reflect on the last six months and think about all the work that we've done and what I've learned. I've also did a lot of thinking about what's to come in the next six months and where I want to be at the end of service.</p>
<p>Josh and I did a six month check it to evaluate how I was doing and how we were doing over all. Most all of the feedback was positive and constructive and it was a good way for us to talk about the projects that will be coming up in the next few months.</p>
<p>The most immediate project is to help public education around the Digital Television Transition. It's becoming really clear as the transition date comes closer that the government poorly planned the transition. Even President Elect Obama has suggested that the timeline for the transition be revised to allow more public education around the issue. </p>
<p>DEI has been working on the transition from the beginning and have made the transition a priority in the first six months of this year. We currently have some useful tools on site and will be putting up videos soon on the the transition. </p>
<p>As far as more immediate projects, we've wrapped up our video, "Internet is Serious Business" and will be looking to do some screenings here in New York. We're using the video as a tool to introduce people to how the Internet works and the policy issues that are related to access to the Internet. After the screenings we hold brief discussion where people can ask questions about the topics in the movie. You can check out parts of the movie here: <a href="http://peoplesproductionhouse.org/dei/video/uploaddownload" title="http://peoplesproductionhouse.org/dei/video/uploaddownload">http://peoplesproductionhouse.org/dei/video/uploaddownload</a>.</p>
<p>Till next month.</p>
