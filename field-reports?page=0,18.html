				<p>Well it's been a week now that my supervisor as well as a few others have been in Africa or at least on their way there.  The site for the project is finally up:  thehouseissmall.org  It's a pretty great interactive site that Eugene, our web guy, built himself with php.  impressive.<br />
I, on the other hand, have been working on the projects Joanne left me with before she flew away.  The main project has been designing a logo for the BeyondMyspace site.  I thought this would be easy, but it actually is not so much.  Designing for others was always the part that worried me, when I thought I'd go out in the world and try to be a real designer.  My aesthetics, although ocassionally within the realm of what others deem "pretty", is more likely strange, eccentric, and my own deluded vision.  SO it really has been a good experience for me to design, receive feedback, and redesign.  I really do think it will help me to grow as a designer.  I'm also going to begin working on a logo for the new adult class offerings at Venice Arts.  So logo fun never ends.<br />
Another project was being given free reign this month to create "educational materials" for a Flash workshop and class I will be mentoring.   Essentially this means I'm making work using Flash, my photographs, music, and video clips, to create a digital story of sorts.  So that is the really fantastic part of this job.<br />
I'm also assisting with web updates for the news section of the V.A. website.  I'm trying to attend the NAMAC conference which would be fantastic and I am going to be attending the National Guild of Community Schools of the Arts(talk about a mouthful) in November.  </p>
<p>I've been a little frustrated or confused about my position here at times.  I'm told to work on certain projects, but then others seem to think these projects aren't neccessary, important, or worthwhile.  And in fact, I've wondered if things, such as working on new design templates for the BMS site are actually even going to be considered.  I enjoy doing this work, but I'm not a college student anymore and I'd like to be taken a little more seriously.<br />
Also there's the annoying aspect of everyone in the organization acting as my supervisor and sometimes ordering me to do the most petty crap.  I try to take it in stride and watch that I'm not in fact being used for purposes other than what I'm meant to.  It is hard to do this at times in such a small place, without seeming like a brat.<br />
I do believe in this organization though and truly want to do as much helpful work here as possible.</p>

	    <p>The flash project sounds great. Is it for youth, older adults, community members? We are bereft of any flash tutorials on the wiki and would be excellent if you would post it when it's finished/tweaked. </p>
<p>Also, don't ever hesitate to say no to what your organization asks if it is above and beyond your work plan. Just remember you have one supervisor and one only. Funnel everything through her if necessary and have her be the one who tells people that you aren't supposed to be doing these things. Using the 'direct service' vs 'capacity building' argument wins almost 100% of the time, too, because you're not there to do menial tasks. If all else fails tell your VISTA Leader or Project HQ. That's why we're here.</p>

I agree with you (when you said you don't always know what to do), sometimes I feel swamped with stuff, but more often than not I'm trying to find stuff to do. It doesn't help that my supervisor doesn't work at my building (or get up before noon). Sometimes I feel like I'm just wasting my time.<br />

	    <p>Hey Angela,<br />
What you're going through sounds about right for a 2 (?) month old VISTA.  Many VISTAs (myself included) have experienced something like what you're experiencing: a supervisor who is far away or not available, multiple people thinking you're a 'volunteer' to lump conflicting/unrelated tasks on you - not to mention the stresses of adjusting, finding and listening to your path as you begin this chapter of your life.  For many, being a VISTA is their first foray into the professional world...  That being said, it can certainly get stressful, but their are ways to manage.  Kevin's points above are excellent and aren't much different than what I would suggest.  Maintaining your right to decline work (particularly if it is outside of your workplan - which you shouldn't be doing anyway) can be a very empowering thing.  If you keep in mind that you are a VISTA first and foremost (something far greater than the scope of your daily, constantly evolving tasklists) you may find that saying no to these 'other' tasks is easier than you think.</p>
<p>Okay, enough blathering.  Do you know about Photoshop 'layer comps'?  Check it out.  They rock for presenting design ideas to support staff/art directors...</p>

	    <p>Angela, after stuffing 400 envelopes for corporate sponsorships, I feel what you are saying about your organizational problems. At NTEN, I too feel like I'm given a lot of administrative assignments and don't have a space to truly express myself and put into practice my ideas.</p>
<p>It seems to be a widespread problem as I have spoken with many others who express similar concerns. I believe it comes down to the disturbing trend of many nonprofits adopting practices from the "business sector," in this case hierarchical organizational models. Rather than taking a more open and horizontal approach where decisions are discussed and staff have more control over their work ("workplace democracy"), we are treated like interns and placed at the bottom of the totem pole.</p>
<p>To make such fundamental changes probably will require some time. However, I think there are some immediate ways the CTC*VISTA project can help. If even VISTA leaders admit this is a typical problem, maybe the project could conduct a more intense screening process for organizations before people like myself, Angela, and others pick up our lives and travel all the way across the country to commit ourselves. At the very least I think it would be pretty easy to mandate some training for supervisors as to what VISTAs are supposed to be doing.</p>

	    <p>Thank you for making this comment Rob.  I feel like it is completely necessary to hear this, especially after coming away from my experience with a definite bad taste in my mouth.  My organization, in essence, had no idea what they wanted with a VISTA.  They simply knew it was a free person to use around the office, to fill spots where highly paid positions used to exist, and to treat with a complete lack of respect.  I really didn't feel as naive as I appear to have been, believing that my supervisor was looking out for me or at the very least, was my friend.  I should have known better.<br />
I definitely agree with a better screening process.  The potential supervisors should be interviewed and the intentions for the position should be more thoroughly researched than with simply a "workplan."  A workplan, I might add, my supervisor initially mentioned she had merely thrown together.  It came to be seen this was most certainly the case.<br />
It is a huge ordeal to pick up and move away from friends and family, to start over.  I felt it would be worthwhile in the end because my position would at least offer some fufilling work that would allow me the chance to be working with others for others.  Regardless of my own personal problems, I left my workplace disillusioned, disturbed, and more distraught over the state of non-profits in our society and those individuals within supposedly representing "social service."</p>

				<p><em>This week's post from my CCTV blog.<br />
Background: Neighbor 2 Neighbor is one of the major projects I'll be working on this year. N2N will give Cambridge residents the opportunity to cover neighborhood issues as citizen journalists. Our goal is to create monthly cable programming and an online database of hyper-local multimedia content (with special attention to our Google-generated media map). It's funded in part by a J-Lab grant. </em></p>
<p>Now that Neighbor 2 Neighbor is beginning to take shape, we’ve been reaching out to community activists to help us continue the process of recruiting, as well as to enlighten us with their issue-area expertise. Discussion of technical skills is taking a backseat to the looming question of content.</p>
<p>One question that came up: Does the focus of all media produced for N2N have to be issue-oriented? In theory, that’s supposed to be a core value of the program, so it should always be a primary goal; we’re realizing, however, that there’s more than one way to approach issues-oriented citizen journalism.</p>
<p>In order to explore these methods, I’m going to produce two very different short pieces that both address community issues, but in opposite ways. As I go through the production process, I’ll be taking notes as a reference for our citizen-journalists-to-be. The emphasis of Neighbor 2 Neighbor reports should be on conception and distribution; production value comes second. An effective strategy for generating community engagement is the most critical component of our citizen media. Production can be quick-n-easy. (Think about the cell-phone videos that you see on the nightly news because the big-time producers just weren’t there.)</p>
<p>One of my experimental videos will be directly issue-driven. It involves the future of a small community, but it speaks to a much larger issue. And for the affected individuals, this issue threatens their living situation. So it’s one small place with a very serious issue that requires a lot of attention…and you can see how that would drive more content on the same topic.</p>
<p>The other one will be a positive story that could be considered indirectly issue-driven -- a profile of the owners of a popular venue in the same neighborhood. Singling out one super-successful business can illuminate the landscape of businesses in Cambridge that can’t keep afloat, and it begs the question of how businesses can thrive. Its power extends beyond that of traditional journalism because a survey of customers on any given night wouldn’t necessarily provide the insight that an online portal for active, interested citizens would.</p>
<p>Both stories are geographically-focused, and would be important additions to the media map: one because it is such a powerful story, and the other because it would attract a lot of attention – and the greater the reach, the more potential for having an impact by striking an unexpected chord.</p>
<p>Another question that came up this week was about objectivity. Can our citizen journalists be opinionated? This is not an easy one to answer. We want to encourage individual voices, and stimulate discussion; but at the same time, we must preserve journalistic integrity. So, if one citizen journalist deeply editorializes, then another citizen should contribute an opposing viewpoint to round out the picture. Citizen journalism is all about free speech, but it’s important that our project allows people to see both sides of each issue covered.</p>

	    <p>It's awesome you're creating media to explore the potential of citizen journalism instead of just postulating. That's as experimental as media gets. But in the most pragmatic way. Very cool.</p>
<p>Do you have any information, research or resources on citizen journalism? It would be great to get some of that up on the CTC VISTA wiki. Every PEG access station I've come across is dealing in some way with exactly what you're talking about.</p>
<p>If you've got time you should swing by Boston Neighborhood Network (BNN) and check out the summer youth program that AJ McGuire and Julie Bohnlein (both current VISTAs). Essentially it's citizen journalism for youth. Contact AJ and he'll fill you in on the details. </p>

				<p>We have received a donation. I went along with a co worker and picked it up today (Friday). I went and looked at the donation on Wednesday. Gathered all the information about it. Checked the value of it and it's accessory as it will be sold to assist in funding our TechACCESS project. Found this donation to be in great condition fully functional and easy to use. Called the individual who handled all the required maintenance and received an excellent report from him. As well as care instruction to pass along to whomever purchases this item. Contacted the state authorities as to how to handle the transfer of ownership esp since we are not going to use it ourselves but rather sell it.....By now your asking what we have received.  </p>
<p>We have had donated to us 1 Dodge Grand Caravan Stretched (and lowered) accessible van. It has a kneel on it...which means with the push of a button it just about lays on the ground so the ramp folds out and entering the van is made easier. It can be used with the kneel feature either on or off for entering the van. It also has other accessible features. It came with a new electric wheel chair so that whomever purchases it will be able to anchor the chair into the front passenger side and ride as the passenger or if able to drive they can transfer to the driver seat. There is possibly if it wasn't removed another anchor under the driver seat if the user is able to drive but it may not be compatible depending on what wheelchair the driver needs or it may have been removed. Since I lacked the proper tools to pull the driver seat out at the time this is in need of confirmation. </p>
<p>I have experience with accessible vans as my grandmother has always had them since I was a small child. I've driven a couple of them when she has needed help (which wasn't often) and always been taught how to use the ramps or lifts when she decided she preferred a lift. This one can easily be suited for a new owner if they are required to do anything at all to it (most vans are custom built to the individuals needs however if they have not required to drastic an amount of customizing they can easily be resold for a different user). Since the main thing is that the van and wheelchair be compatible with each other the donation of the chair the van was built for along with the van is great. It will make it much easier for potential new owners to see if the van is a good match for them and their needs. Luckily for us this van received a minimal amount of customizing.</p>
<p>Pics of it are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yesbiz/sets/72157601148437644/">here</a> if anyone wants to see.</p>

	    <p>Nice van for a donation. Plus it comes with a compatible chair. That's amazing. Have you had any luck finding construction donations (dry wall, lumber, etc.)? I know you were trying to get Lowes or Home Depot to deliver on some in-kind donations for rebuilding/upgrading the facilities at YES.</p>
<p>Also, I mentioned this to Pat in an email but I was planning on coming out to Orange next week sometime and see how everything at YES is going. Does next week work/what day?</p>

	    <p>Next week would be fine. If you want to give me a call we can coordinate schedules.......that still sounds strange to me lol. Not used to having to schedule meetings and such yet. </p>
<p>I will be contacting Lowes about the donations of building supplies. My supervisor and I are working on a presentation for them. We qualify for their assistance program they offer so the first step is forming a list of exact needs and meeting with the store manager for our area.</p>

				<p>So, I attend the NP2020 Conference in Grand Rapids, MI from July,26-July,26<br />
The conference structure was open discussion so, that gave me the opportunity to focus on thing I was interested in. My goal was to attend the conference to do some networking and find out about new development strategies for my org. However, I did do alot of networking with other orgs, but  I found that I was more helpful to other orgs in terms of telling them about new web-based programs such as, egroupware and Salesforce. Also I participated in a group discussion called Oh Very Young! The purpose of this discussion was to find out how people new to the nonprofit world feel about.  We talked about our future plans for the nonprofit world and what kind of skill we need to contribute to.

				<p>At least that was what we were going to entitle our volunteer alert. Thought better of it at second glance. The Director of Teaming for Technology and I attended the John Mayer concert on Tue. night at our area's big amphitheatre to work a concession/vendor stand as a fundraising project. There was quite a process to be invitied, to host a stand, get certified to sell alcohol, etc. etc.--it took the better part of a month. We showed up excited and left dejected. It was chaos and we ended up not only not making money but losing it. We will not be going back for round 2!  However, a very positive aspect of the adventure was the public recognition our project received. It was a great networking opportunity and we were right in front of our core market that we need/want to reach. And since we were holding beer they wanted we had their undivided attention. We had people come back all night long to buy from us because we had made a connection with them about where their money was going. So, from a marketing/community outreach project it was a slam dunk. Money, not so much.</p>
<p>On the home front, I am struggling to find the happy medium between two bosses. One, my immediate supervisor, understands that this is a "people" business and relationship building and face time are of the highest importance when you're getting ready to ask somebody for something. Her superior, while very nice and very understanding, does not seem to grasp this aspect of the non-profit sector. Having spent 30 years in the for-profit world might have something to do with the disconnect. We use Volunteer Solutions as a volunteer agency/opportunity management tool here. It is essentially a dead tool--is not being used and has not been used for close to 2 years. It is my assignment to revitalize the volunteer outreach that Triangle United Way does directed through Volunteer Solutions. I delivered my first synopsis of work last week at a staff meeting, on the day that marked my completed first month of service, and had quite a bit to report. My comments were that while I thought Volunteer Solutions was entirely capable of doing what was being asked of it, since it had not been used in so long I was going to have to be essentially doing its job for at least 6 months. I relayed the information and reactions I had received in my recent site visits to our member organizations in the last few weeks--all of which had been negative. The highlights from my meetings were that the TUW is "big brother" and has very little understanding of its agencies. I had to report that, from what I saw, those perceptions were true and it was going to take a lot of 'bridge building' on my part to the program directors and volunteers to get them back in the habit/mindset of turning to TUW and Volunteer Solutions for their needs. It's an uphill march, but I stressed that it is one that I think is not only worthwile and capable of being reached--it is essential for the namesake of Triangle United Way. So, I have a big job but I am encouraged by the support of my superiors (my colleagues will get there eventually) and the people I've met at our agencies. This is apparently an issue that has been tossed around for a few years without a solution, so, to quote one of my bosses "we went and got you." It's ok to be both flattered and scared by that comment, right?</p>

				<p>Hello Team,</p>
<p>Today we are moving 12 wonderfull PC heavy duty work tables into the lab. These were doanted by Northrop Gruman when they closed a local facility. They are perfect for 2 workstations per table and the lab which is prewired with cat5 to a patch panel. The tables all match! What a concept for donations. 24 stations. This rocks! Now to find 24 matching workstation so that we can "multi cast". I have a Dell Power Edge with 2 mirrored drives for a Lab Server.</p>

	    <p>nice furniture and ambiance i think are oft overlooked with computer labs.  Having matching furniture, nice lighting, clean keyboards - all of this can help boost the technology confidence of the communities you work with.  Heck, it could even be a leadership building role for one of your volunteers - 'I now knight you as official Computer Lab Guardian/Curator/Caretaker/Conservator/Trustee/Steward' etc.  You could even say Warden - this IS a former jail, eh?</p>
<p>Giving people titles as they work can be incredibly team building.</p>
<p>Plus it gives people something they can put on their resume.</p>

				<p>In this field report, I list the <em>priorities</em> I have accepted from my beneficiary organization, the <em>challenges</em> I currently see, and my <em>accomplishments</em> to date against the priorities.</p>
<h3>Priorities</h3>
<ol>
<li>Recover the organization's ability to receive e-mail at its normal e-mail addresses.  This seems to have broken in the process of moving the web site to a different hosting company.
</li><li>Make sure two particular notebook computers can print over the office network, and that they have the latest updates of the operating systems and office software they are running.  Investigate and resolve reported issues with documents being written on one computer and not being able to be edited on another (my work on the notebooks has to happen at the convenience of the computer owner/users).
</li><li>Database issues, all aspects:  We need the capability of multi-user simultaneous update of contacts list.  Enlarge data schema to understand concept of who gets credit for recruiting another person to donate.  Support <em>ad hoc</em> queries.  In recommending a choice of contact management system and its underlying DBMS to support all the above, pay attention to ease of use.  In particular, it must be possible to enter the data on forms rather than for example something so difficult as SQL.
</li><li> Website: be able to post some documents for a limited audience to read (this should't be hard).
</li><li>Simultaneous editing of documents by multiple coworkers, including not only content, but also control of style and navigation in web site.
</li><li>Digital stories.  Put all existing stories in a single master repository.  Compile groups of them onto DVDs, with fancy DVD features and extras, for distribution to various audiences or in various types of event or circumstance.  Study and report on any cost tradeoffs that would affect the judgement of whether for having a DVD "burner" in the office, we should buy a burner to hang off one of the existing computers (seems likely), or whether to get a computer with a burner in it (seems unlikely; why get a whole computer just for a peripheral? (especially given that office space is very tight)).
</li></ol>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Seemingly random, intermittent, failures of access to Internet and to local shared file server, over the office network, from the notebook computers.  The notebook computers and the office computers are all running Microsoft operating systems.  In the most recent instances, rebooting the notebook computers seems to have corrected the failures.  I advised one of the owners to keep the computer configured <em>not</em> to suspend itself to memory or disk (so long as it is plugged into the wall).
</li></ul>
<h3>Accomplishments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Made contact with the consultant who controls the web site (and presumably who can help me solve the e-mail issue).
</li><li>Configured the notebook computers so they could print on the office network.  Started downloading and installing Microsoft updates on them and on the office computers.  Advised the owner of one of the notebooks to contact Dell for a solution to inability to check the disk.  Loaded OpenOffice.org on one of the office computers (thinking to gradually get it on all the workstations).
</li><li>Printed the web pages in triplicate to support review and revision of content of web site by three people (traversing the web site manually).  Collated the copies by hand.

	    <p>Hey Jack,<br />
this looks great.  I like this format for writing about what you are doing and needing.</p>
<p>I'm of course a big fan of CiviCRM for a database/CRM solution synced to MySQL accessed through nice forms (which you can configure - particularly if you are not a coder).</p>
<ul>
<li>You can create 'smart queries and save them to be accessed by other users later.</li>
<li>Can create relations between records.</li>
<li>It's 'relatively' easy to use, depending on which options you enable for which types of users.</li>
<li>You administer your site though your browser and through the same interface as your end users.</li>
<li>Has functionality for shared file uploading that can be permission based to limit who can have access to what.</li>
</ul>
<p>.</p>
<p>Here is a demo:<br />
<a href="http://demo.civicrm.org/drupal/" title="http://demo.civicrm.org/drupal/">http://demo.civicrm.org/drupal/</a> (also available for the Joomla CMS)</p>
<p>There are other options out there though I have not tried them and none of them (as far as I can tell) have as tight an integration with your website and content management as CiviCRM does.</p>
<p>Other options include:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.organizersdb.org/" title="http://www.organizersdb.org/">http://www.organizersdb.org/</a> </p>
<p><a href="http://xrms.sourceforge.net/pagebuilder.php?s1=18" title="http://xrms.sourceforge.net/pagebuilder.php?s1=18">http://xrms.sourceforge.net/pagebuilder.php?s1=18</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/" title="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/">http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.vtiger.com/" title="http://www.vtiger.com/">http://www.vtiger.com/</a></p>
<p>nice that you went the 'old school' route too of actually PRINTING UP THE WEBPAGES for folks to go over.  Makes for some nice PHYSICAL documentation.</p>

				<p>I've completed over half of my VISTA year, and it has certainly been a challenge. While I've enjoyed my position and the type of work I'm doing I've been facing a rather difficult dilemma. No matter how hard I work we all make the same amount. I know everyone struggles with the income a VISTA makes. So I know many of you are feeling the pinch. Working so hard and for many hours and having so little monetary reward is a slap in the face when you can't support yourself. This experience has defiantly made me a stronger person, but it has really tested what I'm made of.<br />
I've also reached the point of questioning if the struggles are really worth the effort. And I've come to the conclusion that I'm not working a "job" but building a future career. Which will be much more rewarding in the long run. I'm just wondering if other VISTA's face this dilemma as well? I know the people that we help appreciate the jobs we do.</p>

				<p>The CTC VISTA site has hit over 1000 nodes! Momentous!</p>
<p>Here at Project HQ we're still working out some strategic planning, which will probably be a continuous process throughout the summer. Currently I'm working on a lot of new exciting projects and some other somewhat tedious ones. </p>
<p>The tedious business: documenting everything the CTC VISTA Project does from top to bottom, inside and out. The end result is going to be a Project Manual/Handbook that HQ can use and an edited version for distribution to current and all incoming VISTAs in the future. </p>
<p>The flip side to this text documentation is the fun part: an idea we're working on to create a kind of video manual of VISTA experience. In other words the Project will shoot interviews with VISTAs, profile host organizations, shoot some B-Roll and then send footage back to Project HQ to be edited. After it's all edited comes distribution, meaning a DVD marketing/outreach piece, a video for VISTA training/resources, dropping clips online, and other general outreach and training components. Check out The Plan: <a href="http://ctcvista.org/node/1008" title="http://ctcvista.org/node/1008">http://ctcvista.org/node/1008</a></p>
<p>Also to see what we're working on at HQ, check the 'Project HQ Initiatives' section on the wiki (<a href="http://ctcvista.org/node/1007" title="http://ctcvista.org/node/1007">http://ctcvista.org/node/1007</a>). More will be added soon!</p>
<p>What else am I working on?<br />
- VISTA Recruitment Plan<br />
- Revised Host Organization Orientation plan<br />
- Working with Danielle, UMass Boston's College of Public and Community Service to try and recruit some student interns.<br />
- Making the work plans 'living' (i.e. easily altered online)<br />
- Getting a Project HQ dog or maybe a wii</p>
<p>What ideas do you all have for making the Project serve you better?</p>

	    <p>Great to hear everything's working out so well for you over in Rochester with ACD. Accessibility is somewhat of a new priority area for the CTC VISTA Project. I definitely encourage you to post whatever you research or develop in the Accessibility portion of the Project wiki: <a href="http://ctcvista.org/access_inclusion" title="http://ctcvista.org/access_inclusion">http://ctcvista.org/access_inclusion</a></p>
<p>Also check out the work Rayna Ramirez is doing at the Young Entrepreneurs Society (YES) in Orange, MA. She's heavily into accessibility issues there.

				<p>Well these past couple of weeks have been very productive. I am learning more about the operations of my host organization. About a week ago we had a staff retreat in Columbus, Oh which was very helpful for team building. I was able to meet all of the people who make it possible for Grassroots to be successful. Also, at the retreat I was able to get a clearer understanding of my role in the organization. Since the I have been working on a number of projects. One of my ongoing projects is to develop the domain Crime.org. I am currently looking for people who work in the field of a related field to help with the contents etc. Furthermore, I have been working on evaluating internal operation of the org and client outreach. On July, 26-July,28 I will be attending the NP2020 Conference in Grand Rapid,MI, which I received a scholarship for. At the conference I hope to do some networking with other organizations. In my next report I will give details about what I accomplished or learned at the conference.</p>

	    <p>Doing an awesome variety of things and traveling a lot are definitely some of the big perks of being a CTC VISTA and it sounds like you're getting both! I was wondering what crime.org is? Also what kind of resources are you using to evaluate all the internal operations of the organization?  I'm doing a little of that with an organization I used to work with and anything you've found would be great.</p>

				<p>Last week  as I sat and I wrote,  I was so impressed by the new set up to go with my brand new second term and so I added the picture and wa-la everything went away. So here I am again going to bring you up on what's been happening with Renae.</p>
<p>Back in April a group of us went to conference in Baltimore hosted by NeighborWorks.</p>
<p>I was very impressed by the commitment of the kids. In Baltimore their kids are doing really innovative things. I heard poetry, skits, role playing and a lot of other things they were involved in. Their community was a very big deal to most of the teens who attended the conference and I came away with this wonderful feeling. Some of the things they said in the role play made me examine myself. One young man was the executive director of a center. He had asked one of the teens at his center to come to the board meeting, when the teen arrived he handed him the agendas to hand out. He asked him to greet people at the door, the adult was the child in this role play so the adult actually never became apart of the meeting because the adult (young man) kept coming up with different things for the child to do. I had to ask myself do we really listen to them when they speak, do we treat them as if they should be grateful for the attention we give them, or do we appreciate their since of style, the fresh way they look at things, their ability to move on after they have been disappointed yet again by an well meaning adult who after all thinks they don't really know what they want. We don't give them enough credit, and we don't give them a chance to use the tools we give them. I'm am blessed to be working with a group of kids who are intelligent, trustworthty, honest and creative. </p>
<p>They might be young but they are more reliable then some adults I know and they work just as hard as everyone else at our center to make it the great place it is. Hat's off to you Yasmine, Soncerae, Lisa, and the rest of the Youth leadership program  for all you do! </p>
<p>Our trip to Baltimore also produced another eyeopener. After we went through the classes we had to come up with a project to bring back home that would represent Being the Bridge You Want to Build. We were so hipe about it we planned it at the airport. It is titled Neighbors Helping Neighbors. We came home and began working on it even though we had another event planned for a week before this one would kick off.</p>
<p>So guess what, the Celebration Of Your Gifts to Us was a success. (The one planned the week before.)  We celebrated the partners we have made over the last year and we had food served by the hospitality committee (man can they cook!) and we gave away some pretty neat stuff, certificates, magnets these neat cups I created while in Home Depot looking for flowers for my garden. Yes, and she gardens when she can find the time. </p>
<p>Well anyway needless to say , it was a wonderful event.<br />
Then one week later our Neighbors Helping Neighbors Week kicks off. We were suppose to have a jump castle, all kind of fun stuff for the kids and It rains. We're hoping for this great neighborhood turnout because we've partnered with the City of Charleston, Family Services, Lowcountry Housing and Trust and a host of others to bring to the people all this great information and prizes and it's pouring down rain. IT WAS GREAT! People still came out the, Mayor of Charleston proclaimed it National Neighborworks Week and off we started.</p>
<p>I have literally been on roller skates since then. ( I take that back, I never took off the roller skates! ha-ha.)  We identified eight houses in the neighborhood that needed small construction jobs done to get them to the point that they could get effective weatherization offered by another group called The Sustainability Institute.   The identification of the houses came from a partnership we made last year with The Lead Base Initiative with the City of Charleston.  We have a group name Mission Fuge who did all the work on the houses for the last 6 weeks.  We have seen so much community growth and community pride since we began our mission one year ago,  Rev. King and I. Then guess what? Summer camp opened. Here we go again!</p>

				<p>The 3rd week had more updating for the <a href="http://www.4people.org" title="www.4people.org">www.4people.org</a> website.  I completed updating the county listings for Eastern Washington and started on the county listings for Western Washington (Clark, Clallam, Grays Harbor got done -- started on Island county on Friday).</p>
<p>My eyes are swimming and I sure do wish I had Kedit.  It's so much more powerful than Notepad and doesn't screw up the href links to websites like other editors do.  I'm still considering buying a license since the test version only allows me to edit files containing no more than 75 lines of text.</p>
<p>While the work has been tedious, it's been necessary.  Our I&amp;R system is getting cleaned up in this process.</p>

				<p>Well things here have started to calm down. At first everything was completely insane and the stress level was through the roof. My supervisor did some rearranging with the staff and things are now running smoothly..... so far. We've hired a new staff member as well to assist with the Biz Center. Now the clients are getting personal attention and we are hoping this brings in new clients. This will assist with the funds for my organization. Took some convincing but my supervisor listened and at last agreed. </p>
<p><strong>Things accomplished since my last report are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TechACCESS workshop #1 while it had a small attendance was a great success.</li>
<li>   TechACCESS workshop #2 already has more than double the attendance and new people are still registering.</li>
<li>   Saving forms to assist my project staff in completing meeting minutes for various meetings and activities. They can just select the form and fill it in and save it with the meeting title so the original form may be used over and over. </li>
<li>   Completion and distribution of workshop #1 minutes and other information.</li>
<li>   NQTechACCESS Committee has been formed and I am holding the first meeting on Monday July 23rd.</li>
<li>   I've obtained several donations from local businesses to use in an effort to raise funds. Also I may have gained a new sponsor for some of our youth programs Biz Venture in particular. My supervisor is speaking with her about the details and working that out.</li>
<li>   For the first time ever all the computers in the Cyber Cafe and the Biz Center are fully functional and all have the same programs available.</li>
<li>   My program has come to realize the Terms of Use needed to be changed to cover some ongoing issues with users and at last agreed to let me make those changes. They take effect on August 1st. Along with that my program after a review of the bills has agreed to raise the Cyber Cafe fee. We took into account that some may not be able to pay so we have set up a volunteer arrangement for those who just don't have the 2.00 per month (yup just 2.00 mostly we service teens so anything more they might have a hard time with)</li>
<li>   Our volunteer work party was a success we had a very good turnout and accomplished a lot of clean up and some repairs.</li>
<li>   I have a completed Technology Plan made out that has brought us in well under our technology budget.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Currently I am working on:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Arrangements to do a book fair to benefit my organization through Barnes &amp; Noble booksellers. The people there are even helping me get word out because our town is so small. They're assisting with some mailings. This is an event my organization can repeat year after year if it is a success.</li>
<li>   Arranging an event at the bookstore to draw attention to the organization and what we do. I am currently contacting trainers for assistance and therapy animals to see if we can help each other out.</li>
<li>   Organizing all of the information for the pending book fair to present to the committee.</li>
<li>   Scheduling the next committee meeting. The committee will meet for 2 hours every 2 weeks. So far it consist of 10 members but is growing as I am in contact with other interested parties.</li>
<li>   Working with a dealer for software that assist visually impaired computer users to obtain a software program suitable for users who are blind at a cost we can afford. He is hoping to obtain Jaws for us.</li>
<li>   Attempting to locate 3 computers that are not ancient and are suitable to be used for our accessibility software. We will make these our accessible computers and reserve them for users with disabilities. (all of our computers are ancient and the processors cannot support some of the applications needed)</li>
<li>   Working on obtaining 16 new (never used) computer monitors from the state surplus sales. </li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn't seem like much sitting here looking this over. I keep wondering what I am forgetting. Anyway things are still hectic and the stress level is high but things are getting done.</p>

	    <p>The volunteer work party sounds similar to something we do here at the Triangle United Way in the project Teaming for Technology. I know that's a long title. We have a warehouse full of the inventory we receive-anything from computers to mice to you name it-and we have a full time employee that is in charge of refurbishing all of it. Since it is significantly more than a one person job, we hold "hardware parties" that we invite our member organizations, local companies, and random volunteers to. They come spend however much time they have and we give them things to do like cleaning keyboards and mice or loading software. It's fairly low-tech and easy, but it helps us get a lot done in a much shorter amount of time and the voluteers feel good about what they've done. It's a win-win. It's also been pretty easy to get people to come to them, and I am now fielding numerous requests from several organizations and companies to set up their own regular and exclusive dates they can send their employees to. It's a pretty good idea.</p>

				<p>No, it's not the fame...or fortune...or the layers of paperwork and bureaucracy.   It's definitely NOT trying to explain VISTA to someone for the upteth time.  It was the moment several times this week, after what seemed like the millionth voicemail I left for a VISTA, when a VISTA picked up the phone and said "HEEEaaaaYyyah! Danielle! What is UP?"  </p>
<p>When I could crack yet another joke with Tony about the heat in Arizona.  When When Richard says "Oh Gina, it's Danielle." (implying it'll be a while because he has lots to tell me) and Sarah yells in the background.  When Elisha's answering the main phone for TINCAN and in the middle of writing a grant, but takes five minutes to explain to me why she's excited about her new project finally getting started.  When Naomi said even though the school she worked with was disorganized, she was glad she went and finished the workshop.  When Lauren B. and I get so chatty that we're talking about mothers suing food companies to stop advertising to their kids.  Even when Will blogs "<a href="http://ctcvista.org/node/991">Hey Danielle here's your links</a>."   </p>
<p>When, in the middle of my own crazy day, one VISTA calls to me this amazing story.  When she was at her lowest, thinking that her work didn't affect anything.  And one kid walks up to her and says "I don't get what your job is."  Sigh.  But then the youth listed out all the things he say her doing over the past year, then said "All that wouldn't have happened without you."  That's all it took to make this VISTA want to stay and keep working.  After delays, disappointments and people quitting, she could say to me "Danielle, I'm good...I'm alright. I'm going to keep going strong."   </p>
<p>After 11 months of calling folks, I was actually glad that I had did it.  Even when the stories were sad, or the frustration level was nuts, or even when Gareth and Dan Chen only answer my questions with one word answers. :)  I'm privileged enough to get monthly updates from a group of dedicated people trying to create change at the ground level.  It's  like my own social change reality show....but about people I actually care what they do (instead of freaks like Paul Abdul or Scot Bao). </p>
<p>Peter Miller said at the last PSO, "The Project is entering an era where the direction that the work is taking is really being fueled by the VISTA Leaders."  We made a very conscious decision last fall to be different kinds of VISTA Leaders than the Project had seen before.  We wanted to establish both one-on-one and group relationships with VISTAs that were real and lasted all year.  So that VISTAs weren't just calling us when their paychecks didn't show up or their supervisor was driving them nuts, but they blogged or shared stories of small but meaningful triumph.</p>
<p><em>SO I loved being a VISTA Leader because I got to hear it all.</em></p>
<p>Oh and it's also when the Robot landed on the moon (thanks Paul).</p>

	    <p>Hey Danielle, so awhile back I replied to the comment that you left on one of my posts...but I replied to it on MY page, not yours. Hahaha....yup, that's why I'm a ctc VISTA. Because the T standds for technology and I obviously have mastered all things technological.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's the comment:</p>
<p>Thanks for the reassurance...actually just a few weeks later I really feel like part of the staff. As far as the living situation goes, I'm still living with the director of zumix, but it's been pretty good so I haven't been desperate to look for anything else.</p>
<p>The Concerts are every Tuesday and Sunday from 5-7 pm. The Sunday ones are better because they're in Pier's Park, which is beautiful. The tuesday concerts are right across from the Maverick Square t station.</p>
<p>Will I see you on Tuesday at the Mass area meeting?</p>

			 	<a href="node/996.html" title="Move Completed" rel="bookmark"><h1>Move Completed</h1></a>
			 				 	
			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p>Generation FIVE has completed its move to a smaller office space (although unpacking continues).  I disassembled the four computers and the LAN that connected them to each other, to the printer, and to the DSL modem, helped move them to the new office, and reassembled them there.  I learned the hard way the difference between a straight-through cable and a crossover cable.  I had read on wonderful Wikipedia that there were such things as crossover cables, but just didn't imagine we (Generation FIVE) had so many of them on hand, until I found that for a connection between a hub and a computer, some cables worked and others didn't, and I started looking at the colors of the insulation on the wires where they come into the connectors.  I also learned to look out for broken hooks on Ethernet connectors.  I'm still not sure exactly what conditions have to prevail to convince the router (I guess it is the responsible party) to give the hosts all unique (within our private network) IP numbers.  If I power up everything in just the right sequence, it seems to work.  I haven't come across a cable for the router's console port (it seems to want serial), nor does anyone currently here know how to administer it.  But that may not matter, because it is working.  The DSL took a couple of days to come in from the phone company, but it's now working, too.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I have a pretty ambitious looking list of tasks for the year.  My priority according to my supervisor is to arrange that a certain database can be reached from three workstations instead of just one.  This database is about contacts and when they have donated, attended events and trainings, etc.  Pretty much, the people and the events where they have interacted with the organization.  The data are managed by a tool (or collection of scripts, templates, etc.) called "ebase", which depends on a licensed DBMS, Filemaker Pro, which evidently not only costs money but requires either a Microsoft operating system or a Mac.  We may be looking at paying money for an upgrade to multi-user, while there may be software out there that will do it all for free.  I'm not sure whether it is riskier to spend the money on new licenses (and maybe find later it wasn't necessary and we can't get the money back), or spend the time researching moving to a different DBMS and/or "relationship" or "contact" management system or the like (and maybe lose too much time researching).  My supervisor thinks anything other than continuing with the current tool, upgraded as necessary, is too complicated to even think about, and maybe he is right.</p>
<p>Gen 5's web site is being handled by a consultant I haven't been introduced to yet, but from how it allows an administrator to update the content by editing over the web, it could be running on one of those content management systems (Drupal, Joomla, Plone, or similar).  Do contact management and content management overlap somewhere?</p>
<p>Then there's another goal, to arrange that coworkers in remote cities be able to update the office database the same way as people in the central office can.</p>
<p>There may or may not be some solution to all three of these goals, but my priorities for some of them over others, along with constraints on how fast I can find out the requirements and desires (due to some people being absent for a while and others hard to reach), may make it necessary to solve each need independently of the others, and lose any advantage of possible synergy.</p>
<p>In response to my last report, the subject of saving money came up.  And that leads to the subject of calculating present value.  To save money, it's sometimes necessary to make decisions about whether to pay now or pay later.  For example, if you need a house, there's the rent-or-buy decision.  And for equipment and software, the buy-it-or-build-it decision.  For figuring out which option will save money and which will cost more, it's necessary to calcualte present value, or the time value of money, as they say.  And for that, you need to know the inflation rate (or so I contend).  You need it to calculate the real interest rate from the nominal interest rate by subtracting the inflation rate.  So, what rate is safest to use, for the inflation of the USD?  And once you know that, what do you use for the nominal interest rate, that on Treasury bills, or that on bank CDs?</p>
<p>For a real example where the time value of money would matter, there's the question of whether to try to sell the (friendly) co-tenants of the building on sharing our DSL, vs. keeping quiet, in which case they would probably continue to use their cable service and we would continue to use our DSL service.  A monthly saving would be secured if we shared, but there would an up-front cost to wire the building to connect our respective private LANs together.  Pay so much now, to save so much a month, forever.  A classic time-value-of-money question.</p>

				<p>Things are in full swing over at the Grand Rapids Community Media Center.  My supervisor is gone this week, which has been an opportunity to show the rest of the staff that I can handle things.  I am currently working on a project with a program called ArtWorks.   I am creating a PSA in Spanish for the Urban Institute of Contemporary Arts with my new high school aged friend, Brenda, from the Dominican Republic.  It is great to be practicing Español again....</p>
<p>In collaboration with the UICA, I recently put together a digital storytellig program for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (GLBT) youth.  It will start Aug. 11th and go for eight weeks, every Sat. for two hours.  I am SO excited to begin, and bring these kids to our organization, show them how to create their own stories, use their voice and then exhibit their work at our theater and on our t.v. station.  </p>
<p>I found the networking and set up for the program to be easier than I thought it would be.  I will be done come Oct. with the first session, but we are looking to have a large number of students who want to sign up.  Possibly multiple programs will take place, and reaching beyond the GLBT community throughout the year will hopefully make this digital storytelling program a lasting success.  </p>
<p>Have a great day, everybody...</p>

				<p>Recently, I’ve been doing a lot of research on capacity building:  What is it? How can we evaluate it? Is there a “best practice” approach to capacity building?  Is there a common conceptual framework for capacity building?  What are the benefits of doing it?  Who should do it? How do you promote capacity building in your organization? In what ways can CTC VISTA build its capacity?  How does CTC VISTA help individual VISTAs build the capacity in their organizations? </p>
<p>I’ve found some helpful resources that address some of these questions.  I’ve been using them, along with a book titled <em>Communication Planning: An Integrated Approach</em>, to help with CTC VISTA’s ongoing strategic planning.  The Project is also working on developing internal communications, outreach, and fundraising plans that summarize the goals and implementation procedures for those areas.  </p>
<p>The capacity building work we’re doing so far doesn’t change what the Project does, rather it provides a useful framework that helps us stay focused, productive, and capable of evolving with the needs of those we serve.  It also helps clarify the Project and eliminate transitional issues in an organization with an inherently high turnover rate.  Eventually the Project might develop new ways in which to evaluate its own capacity building, and the capacity being built by individual VISTAs.   </p>
<p>I’d be very interested to hear anyone’s thoughts on or their experiences with these issues.  I’m attaching two of the resources I’ve found very helpful in this process.  Here, too, is a link to the <a href="http://www.managementhelp.org/org_perf/capacity.htm" title="Free Management Library">Free Management Library</a>, which has additional resources and links.</p>

	    <p>Haven't read your articles yet as I write this.</p>
<p>My thoughts:</p>
<p>One way to think of this, a way I think of it, is<br />
building in efficiency.  That takes getting to know<br />
the "rhythm" so to speak of an organization - how,<br />
why they do what they do.</p>
<p>Efficiency should be, my understanding, something<br />
consistent with how an individual works, an organization's<br />
process, workflow, philosophy, policies, an individuals as well as an organization's likes and dislikes. That takes some time to get to know.  </p>
<p>And it's also, my understanding, giving them capacity<br />
consistent with your given organizational mission and abilities.</p>
<p>Example:  </p>
<p>Almost regardless of the organization you're involved<br />
with, these underlying concerns may provide a springboard<br />
to possible capacity building:</p>
<p>inventory tracking<br />
software licensing<br />
user literacy (training / tutorials)<br />
development tools<br />
online presence (RSS, website, infrastructure, etc)<br />
developmental resources / contacts<br />
organizational process improvements</p>
<p>Basically, as I see it, answering the fundamental question,<br />
how can I within the scope of my responsibilities and<br />
expertise help them do what they do better, more efficiently,<br />
less effort, more bang.  Sometimes it's readily apparent.<br />
Something as simple as developing a checkout system<br />
for a shared resource allowing them to do a better job<br />
of tracking and scheduling.  Other times it may not be<br />
so readily apparent.  You might have to ask questions,<br />
see how they do what they do, get a feel for what their<br />
daily routines and rhythms are.</p>
<p>Taking that time, increases the likelihood that whatever<br />
suggestions, recommendations or changes you attempt to<br />
implement will be consistent with rather than at odds with<br />
their efforts, workflow and goals.</p>
<p>Put yourself in their shoes.</p>
<p>Most people don't appreciate having changes made in their<br />
routine, by people they may not know or trust who may know little or nothing about them, what they do, why they do it.<br />
What you propose is likely to be unhelpful, unused and resented<br />
on that basis alone, nevermind the potential benefits.</p>
<p>All this is involved in leaving things better than you<br />
found them.  Capacity building is a collaborative effort<br />
which involves the consent and cooperation of those you<br />
hope to build the capacity of.</p>
<p>My best successes have been taking all that I've said here<br />
into account.  Sometimes people are perfectly content with<br />
their system and process.  It works for them.  That's all<br />
they need to know.  And that perspective deserves respect.</p>
<p>Best of luck in your efforts.</p>

				<p>Well I think my honeymoon with Los Angeles is offcially over, as 2 hr. bus rides(thats 4 hours a day) are only tolerable for so long.  However, I will be moving very close to work this weekend, so its only a few days longer.</p>
<p>The big news for Venice Arts is the continuation of an Africa photography project entitled "The House is Small, but the Welcome is Big."  It began in 2006 with Venice Arts folks travelling to Capetown and giving out digital cameras to women and children living with HIV.  The resulting photographs are SO amazing and meaningful.  You can see them here if you like:  <a href="http://www.venice-arts.org/studentWork/socialart/ilivehere/ilivehere.html" title="http://www.venice-arts.org/studentWork/socialart/ilivehere/ilivehere.html">http://www.venice-arts.org/studentWork/socialart/ilivehere/ilivehere.html</a>.  On August 1st, my supervisor, Joanne, as well as both directors of V.A. and a few others will be travelling over there again and handing out cameras to teens.  They will be gone for a month and I will be assisting with the website that is being created to document this project.  Already last week, I assisted in getting photos ready, resizing, and getting copy ready.  This is a really exciting project!</p>
<p>Also Pablo Toledo, our director of digital media, has been responsible for creating the Institute for Photographic Empowerment at USC.  This place will be a resource for those interested in doing work similar to V.A. or for other institutions who would like to offer info.  This is a great exciting endeavor as well.</p>
<p>As for me the past two weeks,  I assisted in hanging an art show(my first time!) that will raise money for Venice Arts.  It's called Gates of Venice and features 38 of the many gates in Venice.  All of which are a colored eccentric variety.  I taught 2 more Art Discovery classes for the lil tykes- intro to drawing and making musical instruments.  I'm also the tech support person for the weekday classes.  I get printers to print, scanners to scan, and monitors to well...monitor.  I learned some about routers and access points as well as the need of wep passwords.</p>
<p>I had a meeting on the beach with my supervisor(like so l.a.- hahaha) and we discussed my involvement in the Beyond Myspace website.  Besides acting as an online moderator and facilitator, I will be working on the actual design of the site.  I will create a logo and redesign the site for usability as well as aesthetically.  I'm also working on finding individuals to act as guides on creating a Policy Committee.  My only problem so far, is that this information is rather vague and not detailed enough for me to actually be doing anything.  I've been doing research and writing down ideas, but my supervisor is consumed with this upcoming trip.  I suppose I wish I could be of more use.  But the people at V.A. tell me I am doing good whether I know it or not.</p>

	    <p>Hey Angela, </p>
<p>Your day to day tasks sound awesome.  I went to the website the African Photography project, and I think it is just amazing.  If Venice Arts has any openings for a videographer after this VISTA year, please let me know...</p>
<p>Traffic in L.A. is horrendous, good luck with the move and I love hearing about your organization!</p>
