				<p>Sacramento reminds me of where I used to live, except there's a few more bodies all around me.  What I'm working on is multifaceted but in a nutshell I'm designing the new curriculum's layout to give my organization more information on less pages.  What they have been working with is a word document without page breaks and I am creating an InDesign project file that when finished can be saved as a PDF file or sent to an outside print shop.</p>
<p>Additionally, I've already begun to help form new policies focused on best practices and will be revamping the employee handbook from mid October through mid December.</p>
<p>What has helped me are the resources that are in close proximity to me.  Four people who I met recently are a curriculum designer, a PBS affiliate program manager, a local college's community outreach director and someone who works with California Child Labor law.  There have been a couple of electronic resources I've found as well.  Streaming Media Magazine is an Industry standard magazine that has produced white papers and other research material about streaming web content.  A second and third resource has been the webinars available from Adobe and Apple's websites.  Finally, IDEO's toolkit about Human Centered Design has been very helpful as a touchstone for design and can be found in PDF form on their website(as it's too big to attach here).</p>
<p>There are  challenges though, the greatest of which is making everyone, especially the teen staff, feel like they are competent in their skills and letting them know its okay to make mistakes to grow.</p>
<p>I've included a cover design for the new curriculum.</p>

<p>That cover does look really good. Its great that you have been able to take advantage of local resources, there's nothing better than actual human contact! Glad to hear that Sacramento has been working out, though your first sentence makes it sound pretty rough. Let me know if you'll be down in the Bay Area soon.</p>

				<p>Time is flying so fast, I can't believe it! </p>
<p>New Mexico is absolutely beautiful and I love where I live and all the people I'm meeting and working with.</p>
<p>I'm working at the Media Literacy Project located in Albuquerque, New Mexico (the organization was formerly known as "New Mexico Media Literacy Project"). I've arrived at a very exciting time for the organization. They are in the midst of their organizational strategic planning and are in the process of creating a new mission, vision, and guiding principals. The plan also includes their organizational goals, objectives, and tactics (activities) for the next five years. </p>
<p>Part of the more immediate changes is/was their name change as mentioned above. As I'm here to update their existing main web site from plain HTML to a more efficient content management system (CMS)- the change in name meant a new logo had to be designed, which in turn will dictate the new look and feel to the site. For the last two weeks I've been in the process of designing their logo. We've had three meetings so far and the final logo review will be this Thursday, September 3rd. The final, FINAL okay will be left to the Director when she returns after the Labor Day holiday.</p>
<p>Prior to these last two weeks of logo consumption - I did training for Joomla! (My choice for CMS.) This took a good week to get through and I'm sure I'll have to go over sections again when I actually get started on the web site design itself next week. I highly recommend the Joomla! training dvds from lynda.com - there are a set of three that go together and for the most part seem to cover every aspect of how their version of CMS works and most important (for a designer)- how to customize the templates.</p>
<p>Last week I knew I had finally "really" settled in because I wrote postcards to friends and family and didn't go to Lowes, Target or the Big Lots store for apartment stuff : )</p>
<p>I feel very fortunate to be where I am for many reasons - not the least of which is working with my fellow VISTA Candelario Vazquez. He is so much fun and in the first couple of weeks here we really helped eachother make it to the first paycheck!! </p>
<p>So, by this time next month I hope to be telling you all about my trials, tribulations and triumphs working with our new logo on the new web site. </p>
<p>That's it for now. Peace.</p>

				<p>Things have been going pretty well at the Community Software Lab. I've spent the majority of this month on a pretty interesting project of migrating the current code repository for the CSL's main web product, MVHub (<a href="http://www.mvhub.com" title="www.mvhub.com">www.mvhub.com</a>), from subversion to bazaar. I had no experience with version control software prior to this and it was a great project for getting some experience with them as I researched how the two VCS implementations were different in order to do a smooth migration from one to another. The migration is 99% complete and I just performed a presentation of how to use bazaar to the volunteer coders at the CSL. It should be complete by the end of the week and then I'll move on to my next assignment.</p>
<p>I went to a meeting of the board members earlier this month as well, and it was great to get to meet them. They are a really enthusiastic and approachable crowd of people. We mostly discussed how we can get the CSL actually have an income stream, not a small task. I was involved in the creation of the budget for the next year, and I hope that by the end of my VISTA term my contributions have allow the CSL to meet the goals we set.</p>

				<p>My nonprofit is pretty small. We've got a one room office, where me and the other staff worker do our work. In this one room, undergraduate students, graduate students, high school students, even a few professors and staff filter through each day to use computers, hang out between classes, and volunteer. Forget about 10% direct service, I feel like I could spend half my day just chatting with people and doing no work at all. </p>
<p>In an effort to concentrate, I've set up my computer facing the wall for now. I appreciate how friendly everyone is. Lunch breaks are awesome, but I'm not very good at concentrating, so I have to concentrate on concentrating or I'll jump into every conversation people start.</p>
<p>My two big projects for the year are pulling all the workshops they've run into a comprehensive curriculum, and to get the website to be useful. We've got a lot of videos and other media we'd like to display, but our website is a little less than functional.</p>
<p>I've spent my first month focusing on the curriculum. I've gone through two years' worth of workshops outlines (out of about 16 years on file), seen them run a series of Asian American history workshops, and thought a lot about how to make a document that will remain relevant for more than a few years.</p>
<p>I'm more worried about the website than the curriculum, since I have far less experience in web design than in education. Maybe that's why I haven't started on it yet. </p>
<p>I'm attaching a flyer I did for the Asian American Studies Workshops, not because its particularly impressive, but because I'd like to attach something.</p>

				<p>Reviewed the current equipment at NESFP, and created a wishlist of new equipment that I feel would benefit the organization in their media expansion.  New Equipment: digital HD camcorder (Canon VIXIA HF S10), one External Hard Drive (G-Technology 1TB G-Raid3), an external Disk Burner (LaCie d2 Blu-ray Drive), blank disks and a spare battery for the camera.  The Blu-Ray burner is for archiving raw and edited video for their long-term storage.  The new camera and accessories have arrived!  I am getting familiar with our new toys.  The Canon camcorder is great. We had our annual open house farm tour this month.  Our first shoot was successful. I worked on creating a database of footage from Final Cut.  This is a pretty straight forward process.  In Final Cut Pro, you can export a batch list of any bin or bins with footage.  This file can then be imported into a spreadsheet.  The idea behind creating this database is to enable a user to search the existing video library for footage and interviews. Hard drive space management might be an issue as we shoot more (ie: running out of room for all footage).  In field with Don and Ben to videotape the assembly of a greenhouse.  Also went to video Swine School in N. Grafton.  This was an all-day event including lecture and demonstration with all things Swine.  Rough cut shot and edited of Equipment training.  Also edited a rough cut of photo promo.  Using Vimeo to host rough cuts, and eventually Youtube for promos.  Shooting schedule is busy through October.  and now..back to you.</p>

				<p>The first month here has gone pretty well.  Idealware is organized, and the two other employees have great experience and expertise - so I'm learning a lot!  Already my job as expanded, which I'm glad for (I would have been bored with too much research).  I'm currently working on a "Fieldguide" to software for nonprofits, and its been exciting incorporating the research into a result that I can see.  4 sections down...11 more to go in the next three weeks.  </p>
<p>I've also been developing our social media strategy, and we will be launching a FB page something around September 16.  Trying to put a lot of time in up front so that we are prepared and don't have to run any firedrills once we launch, and figuring out how it works in with out overall communications strategy.  Keep an eye out for when we launch FB because I will be blogging about our strategies and what works/doesn't work/etc. I am trying to set out clear metrics against which to gauge our success (which you will find out after the fact on our blog).</p>
<p>We are also doing a rebranding exercise and redesigning our website - so lots of activity!  All of this is on top of my ongoing research for our social media "don't-yet-know-what-the-final-product-will-be" project. </p>
<p>All in all, things are going well!</p>

				<p>It's like being in Hawaii with the extended family.  Being called "hapa" brings back the memories.</p>
<p>At the moment, I'm writing a manual that will serve as a crash course in wireless networking, networking hardware, and monitoring/maintaining the networks that are at LTSC.  The goal is to recruit residents from LTSC affordable housing to take care of the wireless internet and have this manual as a resource for them.  It's been pretty interesting to learn about wireless mesh networks, and I think they're a pretty neat alternative to traditional wireless networks.  It is a little weird to be writing a manual for something I am only just learning myself, but the outgoing tech coordinator has been patient and there are tons of great resources online, so it's been a fairly speedy process.  I worry that not enough community members are interested in volunteering to become "network caretakers," but hopefully there will be more interest in the upcoming meetings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, have also been working on planning and deploying a new mesh network that will provide wireless coverage to a new section of Little Tokyo.  This network will for the public and for small businesses (as opposed to the free access LTSC provides for affordable housing).  The next month is going to involve planning the deployment and working with an intern to approach businesses and see if they will host a wireless node and help us build out the network.</p>
<p>The work load so far has been manageable, but am anticipating a lot more work in the next few months as our outreach meetings with tenants become more frequent.  I do feel like I'm juggling a lot of disparate projects, between the deployment of the new public wifi, the affordable housing wifi stuff, and other little projects.</p>
<p>I'm really looking forward to meeting with residents more often.  One of our older residents is a monk...she is awesome and is totally up on technology and using the wireless (and nagging us if anything goes wrong).  There have been sad moments though, like when one of the residents hung himself.  :(  Brings home how isolated and unhappy some of the people who live here are...  Still trying to process that, makes working on wireless feel a little silly you know?</p>

<p>This is my first field report.  Last week was my first normal full week of work at my organization, Thousand Kites.  My first couple weeks of service involved me learning about my organization and its previous work while my coworkers were away on business or vacation.  After that, I traveled to a week-long conference called “Alternate ROOTS” for artists and activists in the South.  The conference was fun and informative, there is a video I made of it on my blog.</p>
<p>Current Projects:</p>
<p>- WEBSITE:<br />
I will assist with a general redesign of the organization website, as well as a new website for a focused campaign to stop “prisoner renting” (transfer of inmates to other prisons far out of state) at <a href="http://www.prisonerrenting.com" title="www.prisonerrenting.com">www.prisonerrenting.com</a>.</p>
<p>- VIDEO FOR OUR WEBSITE:<br />
I will be heavily involved with adding new video functionality to our website, which will use <a href="http://www.magnify.net" title="www.magnify.net">www.magnify.net</a> to create web video channels.  Our new web video content will come from three sources: video we create, video that users submit to our website, and videos from around the web that my organization curates to display on our website.</p>
<p>- DATABASE:<br />
I will be managing the database in salesforce, syncing it with out new email account (with an app called “Appirio Contact Sync”), and setting up campaigns through salesforce using an app called “Vertical Response.”</p>
<p>- MEDIA FOR CAMPAIGNS:<br />
I am editing video for our prisoner renting campaign, and other video.</p>
<p>Specific applications:</p>
<p>- Google Earth Pro: We bought a professional Google Earth account, enabling us to record HD video of prison locations to use for web videos<br />
- Salesforce: Apps: Appirio Contact Sync, Vertical Response<br />
- Final Cut Pro: for video editing<br />
- Google Apps: I set up a new email account through Google Apps for business that can sync with salesforce</p>
<p>Challenges:<br />
Troubleshooting technical issues with Google Earth Pro video recording</p>
<p>Resources:<br />
Google Apps, Salesforce, Google Earth Pro</p>
<p>I look forward to:<br />
Developing more video for our redesigned website, editing more video for our "stop prisoner renting" campaign, and recording more movies with Google Earth.</p>

				<p>Last Monday marked my first day of work at the Minnesota Legal Services Coalition. The office isn't very big, but that suits me just fine since it's easier to become familiar with the area, names, faces, etc. The first day was basically going over office policy, meeting everyone who works here, and then an extremely brief overview of the computer programs I will be working with for the next year.</p>
<p>So far, I have been familiarizing myself with HotDocs, a program developed by LexisNexis for the legal community to help create automated interview forms for court forms and documents. As of right now, I’m still struggling with a form for requesting a legal name change; I’ve been working on it since last Thursday or so. I got off to a slow start at first because the program wouldn’t install properly on the laptop I’m using (I don’t get my own computer/desktop until after the 12th; I’m also sharing my office until then), but it seems that things are in working order now. </p>
<p>As of right now, the challenges I’ve faced have mostly been technical issues with the laptop, but as I mentioned before, I’m still trying to familiarize myself with the scripting language for HotDocs, which is a bit difficult. I was expecting it to be easier since I have knowledge of other programming languages, but it seems that I have to debug ever other line of code that I write. I’ve been reading up on the HotDocs manual and online help guide to address this problem, so hopefully I’ll become accustomed to the program soon.</p>
<p>One thing I'm worried about is the fact that the former VISTA (Kristyn Martin) will only be here until Friday, and I have yet to learn how to use A2J. She's been an invaluable source of information and help with HotDocs, so I'm a little worried about how I'll have to manage and navigate A2J when she's gone.</p>

				<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>What a week! In terms of accomplishments, I've learned so much about Homeless Prenatal, the kinds of services they offer, and why people are coming to the computer lab. I've also had the opportunity to tour and meet with the staff and volunteers of St Anthony's CTC in another part of the city. I'm looking forward to collaborating with them and sharing best practices. Soon I'll be meeting with the ED of Community Technology Network, and I'm really grateful that I'll be able to be a part of a larger network of people working on similar issues.</p>
<p>I've had the opportunity to interview one potential volunteer as well as meet with and observe established CTC volunteers and it's been so interesting hearing about how they got connected to HPP and why they volunteer. The economic crisis is pushing people to think of creative uses of their time, and of course it means their time is much more valuable for our clients who are hit the hardest by employment, health, and housing insecurity. Our lovely governator just terminated all funding for domestic violence shelters- wow.</p>
<p>I didn't anticipate how much of my position is community organizing- building productive and collaborative relationships with and between staff, volunteers, and especially clients. It's going to be challenging, but it's exciting and uncomfortable in all the right ways.</p>
<p>One drawback (there are many more advantages) of having a former CTC Vista as my supervisor is that she has already tried and occasionally failed at many of the ideas that pop in to my head. It starts to get discouraging when I hear for the tenth time "Yes that's a good idea but we've tried that before and it didn't work about because of X or Y reason". The CTC is not a blank slate, it has a lot of history, people, ideas, and projects that I need to be attentive to without feeling totally paralyzed or naive for being a bit more optimistic than everyone else. It's going to be a constant negotiation but I'm positive!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading my e-mail novella (should this be a field report?) and I'm looking forward to hearing about how everything is going for y'all!</p>

				<p>I keep telling myself to post a field report and then it gets pushed under the table, because like Claudia and others I have not found very much down-time! So I thought I'd go ahead and post some stuff I wrote up in my first few days with a few updates.</p>
<p>I've jumped right in to my work here and have hit the ground running (or at least I'm trying!). In my first couple of days I worked on getting up to speed on Miro and Miro Community, and trying to do a little bit of research on tech-related stuff that I'm less familiar with, like CSS, so that I can know the vocabulary that's being used. My supervisor and I spent some time brainstorming ideas for language simplification on the Miro Community sites, and also coming up with more long term things we'd like to see - I've been doing more of that this week as it becomes a priority to develop features for the sites. I've been getting introduced to PCF folks and sitting in on a few related meetings to get a sense of the context of our work, and to learn to explain what I'm doing! </p>
<p>One of the first things my supervisor suggested that I do was decide on a community that I could make a Miro Community site for, which I could moderate and build so that I would be able to get a better sense of what's needed and how things work. I guess this is a little like running through a curriculum in order to know how to improve it, except that in building up the site I'll also be leaving behind an infrastructure that someone else, or ideally many someone elses, can take over when I'm gone. I came up with a bunch of ideas for communities (this is why the Miro Community project is so cool - it has so many potential applications!). A few that I considered were an Americorps site (there is a surprising amount of Americorps video out there!), a site having to do with poverty and community programs, and one related to groups I've been involved with, like the Lesbian Herstory Archives and the NYC Grassroots Media Coalition. However, I decided that for this it would be best for me to focus on something I'm pretty familiar with and could really dig into, with the idea that more could be built later. So we agreed that I would focus broadly on feminist video, and within that I would particularly focus on the practice of fanvidding, hopefully working with the Organization of Transformative Works. This is something I'm really interested in, and while it doesn't directly contribute to the "end poverty" mission, I think it will be a space where I can learn a lot and get a lot of more widely applicable ideas. I also see a lot of potential for coalitions and partnerships, including ones related to poverty. So far I've reached out to a couple of contacts about this and they're excited - it's starting to come together in a way that's really energizing.</p>
<p>Things move very quickly here, and I'm a little worried that I'm not getting enough done/ not keeping up well enough. But I'm trying - reading up on some blogfeeds my supervisor suggested and really just jumping in on developing the Miro Community sites. I tried to set up a call with one group and have been a little disheartened at the lack of response, but we'll keep trying. My supervisor and I met with several groups last week about building partnerships, and it was really valuable for me to hear what their concerns were as well as the potential uses they saw for the project. One thing we heard a lot of, especially from the Public Access folks we met with, is that their supervisors are very wary of new technology until they hear about it externally (so, they don't get why they might want a site like Miro Community but they're really into Twitter because they're heard about it in the news). There's also a lot of concern about adding extra work and anxiety about prioritizing core functions because of the financial crisis. One thing I feel we really need to focus on with these folks is the importance of building sustainable systems so that they can come out of this recession stronger than ever, otherwise I think this could be a near-fatal blow.</p>
<p>I also decided it would be beneficial to attend the NAMAC conference and am working on setting that up - has anyone else heard from the volunteer coordinator? I found Bolt Bus tickets NYC-Boston for $1.50 each way, so I'm pretty happy about that. </p>
<p>Well, I think I should get back to work now, but that's a taste of what I've been up to so far! I've loved hearing about how things are going for you all, too - keep it coming!</p>

	    <p>That's really cool (and smart) that you're starting small and really trying to target one particular community to build. </p>
<p>The Cable Access crowd is always a tough nut to crack. Because of their super-local  focus, the majority haven't built a culture of sharing. And since their money comes from franchise fees (rather than donors) they focus more on political issues (since the fees come through the city and are regulated at the state and federal level) rather than developing community competencies. If you haven't already, talk to our VISTAs John Haffner at CMAP, or John Montgomery at Deproduction, since they are doing collaborative partnerships between Access Stations.</p>
<p>Don't get disheartened: it sounds like you've already done a lot!</p>

	    <p>Thanks, Ben! Actually, one of the places we're talking to is Medfield, so I think Jason was happy to hear I was part of DAScorps. I'm pretty optimistic about things, though it's kind of funny to see how there are such different cultures - we have a very tech culture at PCF, I think, and it's very different than the traditional nonprofit culture. It should be interesting!</p>
<p>By the way, do you know if Colin Rhinesmith's master's thesis on public access in the age of youtube is available somewhere? He seemed like someone you might know.</p>

				<p>I wrapped up a 20-week long after-school outreach I’ve been teaching at an elementary school. I worked with two groups of students: the older group made a documentary about the experiences of their classmates who have moved to the U.S. from other countries, and the younger group made a collection of short instructional videos on topics of their choice (drawing, making a paper airplane, counting to ten in Japanese, making farting noises with your armpit, etc.). </p>
<p>Both videos were screened for parents at the after-school program’s year-end showcase. The kids were excited to see themselves on the screen, and it was really cool to talk to all the parents whose kids appeared in the film or who worked on it. </p>
<p>But the highlight of the month was taking a group of kids to a fancy, televised awards ceremony. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.waycross.org/bluechips/" title="Blue Chip Cable Access Awards">Blue Chip Cable Access Awards</a> are given out each year to recognize the work of volunteer producers of cable access programs in Greater Cincinnati. A short documentary made by one of last summer’s video camps I helped with at Media Bridges was nominated in the “student K-5” category. So, I rounded up the kids and parents to go to the award ceremony, which was held at a grand old restored movie theater. When their group was announced as the winner, I ushered a bunch of mostly shy kids up on stage, where they all got big rounds of applause for their acceptance speeches. One girl’s was, “Thank you, people.” </p>
<p>Here's the group photo, complete with shiny award plaque: <a href="http://ctcvista.org/files/IMG_7496b.JPG" title="http://ctcvista.org/files/IMG_7496b.JPG">http://ctcvista.org/files/IMG_7496b.JPG</a></p>
<p>Both events were good reminders of how important it is to follow through on projects that involve people in creating media. If we want people to realize the power their voices can have through media, we should involve them in the distribution, not just the production. When you put a piece of media “out there,” others will see it, and that is an important media literacy lesson. I see a lot of light bulbs turn on when kids see other people reacting to their work, whether those people are their parents or an entire theater full of people. Distributing one’s work can be an encouraging ego boost, but it can also be humbling and intimidating. Either way, it promotes responsible media-making.   </p>
<p>The award-winning documentary was about an awesome, kid-friendly art museum where you can touch and interact with the artwork. It is called the UnMuseum, and it is housed in Cincinnati’s Contemporary Art Center. You can see the video in the <a href="http://www.mediabridges.org/WatchYouthChannel" title="youth section">youth section</a> of the Media Bridges Web site. </p>
<p>Those of you looking to hone your armpit farting skills will have to wait. I haven’t been able to put those videos up yet. One problem that we constantly have with younger groups is that the instructor always ends up having to do additional editing after the outreach or class is over. Does anyone has a good model for this or any advice?</p>

				<p>Though for most, this is the end of the VISTA term, I'm sticking around through at least February, which I'm excited about. Lots more work ahead. No time to be heading out. Things have been so busy that it's hard to remember exactly what this month has brought. I've done a lot of work with our summer intern, getting him trained and working hard. But also really digging deep into the thinking about planning about how we use volunteers, outreach and market to them, and how we help communities meet their goals. We're experimenting with flipcams as a tool that communities can use to document their stories and I've been working on developing language around the outreach for them. I've also been developing our archive of artistic work to make it accessible and usable for us and our constituents. As we think about moving forward into a new stage of our website, it's important to have a clean and useful database of artistic content. </p>
<p>This next month I'm headed out to Eureka, CA for a professional development residency in community theater. I'm really hoping I'll be able to bring back some ideas and plans for how to strategize theatrical work in our web-based project.</p>

				<p>Fellow VISTAs,</p>
<p>My term is coming to an end later (7/31) than most of yours so I still have some time left to wrap things up.  I've basically just been working with our "in-house" evaluators on the data etc we've collected to put together our report on TAP.  Although I'm bummed about the program not continuing, I've had a really great year and I've learned a lot.  I've been looking for other jobs, so far I've only gotten one real response from the 10 or so resumes I've sent out.  It's kind of nerve wracking but still exciting.  I'll be sure to post our final report and probably pass on the curriculum I worked on to Ben.  I've enjoyed reading about everyone's experiences and will pass along more information/insights.   Good luck to everyone as your years wrap up.  </p>
<p>--Will</p>

				<p>Hello everyone, I imagine this is will be the final post. Well basically I have been doing about the same; meeting with the green project members, getting someone to take over the classes in word, and Linux. The green project meetings continue we have found an interior designer and a professional artist willing to give us a hand, the artist is willing to stay on and teach art. In addition, there are other members of the Obama campaign that are willing to write grants to enable us to get the electric up to code, plumbing repairs, new instructors, books and programs.  I also got individuals to come by to inspect the Arts and Education building. The report was favorable; they said the roof has sound beams and the wood used for beam looked almost new. I talked with my supervisor and we decided to get a summer youth work program started here at the shelter. We have 5 district students to come into our program, most have computer skills so they can work on setting up the Wildtech data base and other technical aspects. There are two students that are sixteen years of age with some construction experience, so we decided to let them work on scraping the walls in the Arts and Education building.</p>

				<p>Hola hola mundo! We have had weird weather in June so far here in Southern California.</p>
<p>Just finished mailing out hundreds of Wired for Wireless Reports. Thanks Stephen for shooting that email, by the way! I am continuing to send out reports. This brings me to the database. Bounced mailed reports are actually in our favor because it helps to clean the database.  And so now, updating the database is of primary focus as well as using GIS tools (most likely Google Maps/Earth) to map out our network.  </p>
<p>Also, I helped organize California Emerging Technology Fund’s (CETF) very first webcast of a new campaign they launched for Southern California titled <a href="http://getconnectedtoday.com/">Get Connected: Your Life Made Easier</a>.  Thanks to the <a href="http://www.bresee.org/">Bresee Foundation</a> who actually brought out the equipment for the <a href="http://www.justin.tv/clip/654017a18088b9e6">press conference</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I recently got a CTC VISTA extension for about three months.  I am blessed to get the extension. I enjoy working here, and there are still a few things I need to get done. </p>
<p>This may be the last month a few of you will be posting. I thank you for your help and your service…I am sounding like the president, jeje. Please stay in (Twitter) touch: @OsoHormiguero.</p>

				<p><img src="http://profile.ak.facebook.com/object2/1742/85/n3184050592_1164.jpg" align="right" alt=" CTC VISTA Project" />Our year's coming to a close, and not all of us are staying on with the CTC VISTA Project, but wouldn't it be nice if we could pass on our wisdom to the incoming class? I propose we create a hashtag on Twitter and tweet advice up till July 27 (I think that's the official start date). The field reports are a rich resource but take a significant amount of time to sift through. Probably several of us will be kicked off the listserv come July 11.</p>
<p>For anybody who's up to it, let's go with <strong><em>#ctcvista</em></strong>. Invite any former CTC VISTAs you know to tweet, and let's keep it constructive!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Twitter's great for bite-sized advice, but for those who don't use it, the <strong><em><a href="http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?topic=8720&amp;post=40722&amp;uid=3184050592#post40722" target="_blank">Facebook discussion thread</a></em></strong> would be an accessible place to leave advice.</p>

	    <p>Great idea Denise! We should be leaving our breadcrumb trails of wisdom for the incoming CTC VISTAs wherever possible. FYI, my Tweets are coming from the account I run for my VISTA project, since I don't have a personal Twitter. I'm @CincyYouthTV.</p>

			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p>Recently I’ve been gathering requirements and consulting on information architecture for another Mercy Corps group, Mercy Corps Northwest. MCNW is doing a major site redesign; and it has been exciting to help them understand their audience (defining user roles and creating surveys) and define/prioritize organizational and user goals for their new site. </p>
<p>I have started wrapping up my work for MicroMentor by ramping up social media outreach. A paradox? Yes and no. With only a couple of weeks left and so much to accomplish I have been concentrating on capacity building at a strategic and tactical level, in order to provide MicroMentor with tools and research that will ease them into a social media presence. </p>
<p>Strategic:<br />
Wrote SEO, Twitter, and Facebook guidelines and research docs, including tips and best practices. In the process of writing an additional report on Google Analytics.<br />
Created a Marketing Dashboard via igoogle for managing social outreach.<br />
	Requirement: ability to log in to one application and address social media maintenance needs quickly and easily.<br />
	Solution: an igoogle marketing tab that includes: a bit.ly shortener, a twitter widget, a google calendar (dedicated to marketing), a Facebook connection widget, marketing to do list, direct access to delicious account for tagging, and feeds from marketing, media and related blogs. Also set up tabs for tracking news feeds about entrepreneurs, nonprofits and mentoring, to facilitate finding interesting (audience specific) content.</p>
<p>Tactical:<br />
Set up a branded twitter account and am tweeting a couple of times a day – to gain followers and establish a “tweet voice”.  <a href="http://twitter.com/MicroMentorOrg">http://twitter.com/MicroMentorOrg</a><br />
Launched a MicroMentor Facebook Page and a Facebook Profile (with Causes); these pages and profiles can be further built up over time. (MicroMentor on Facebook)<br />
Set up specific goals in Google Analytics and auto-generated weekly analytics report which is emailed to MicroMentor.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I am wishing the very best to my fellow CTC Vistas, now and in the future. Mary</p>

				<p>In May/June, I offered several training workshops, likely the last round of dedicated sessions as my year of VISTA service comes to a close.  The remainder of my year will be devoted to compiling the training materials I've written, and writing the manuals I haven't had time to compose yet.</p>
<p>Of the three video production workshops I led, one was an interactive session with students from the READY School in Champaign, IL.  After an initial tour of our facilities and those of Urbana Public Television, the students checked out free camcorders and videotaped a day at their school, with interviews and shots of classrooms, art, bulletin boards, and the building itself.  Our training session covered the fundamentals of cutting, arranging, and editing scenes, using Adobe Premiere Pro.  The students, whose school year is finished, now have two local resources for continued learning where they can finish this and other films if they would like.</p>
<p>Many of the training sessions were about A/V data backup, transfer, and duplication, as members of the IMC get ready to work more independently after I have finished my service.  Beyond these and other basic recording and editing tips, two of the audio workshops addressed key issues for citizen journalists - 1) posting to the web and 2) understanding the principles of digital audio and their application.  Finally, I have been working with our community radio station WRFU, to ensure that members are knowledgeable about making PSAs, news stories, and updating their Drupal site.  In the last month, I will compile and share these resources; for now, I have been revising the manuals as I go, and sharing with smaller working groups.  </p>
<p>Though we often use commercial software like Premiere at the IMC, the only real expenses that any artists or journalists should ever have to face are time and hardware (cameras, mics, computers, a/v equipment, etc.).  I encourage everyone I train to use and tell others about free and open source software (FOSS), and this month I continued my research into these tools.  Specifically, FOSS operating systems can be installed (easily and for free) and used to keep older and slower computers running quickly and efficiently - especially important for organizations with small budgets.  Operating systems I recommend are Ubuntu (which has many variants, including one with media production applications called Ubuntu Studio), Puppy Linux, Dyne:bolic, and Pure:dyne.  There are others, but these systems have familiar desktop and window environments, can be expanded to include office productivity and media software, and some even run off of live CDs, so no installation is necessary.  We received a donated laptop that was quite slow, running Windows 98 - now with the most recent version of Xubuntu, it is much faster and is available for IMC members to use for on-location recording, broadcast, and web publishing.</p>
<p>A critical component of documentation is not just manuals or progress reports, but recommendations.  The final aspect of capacity building requires communicating to your organization what they can do to grow after the absence of VISTA staff.  At the IMC I am in the process of troubleshooting and listing improvements that could be made to the production facilities - via hardware that will need to be purchased, and software that is free.  Luckily for us, we just hired some summer youth employees through the Champaign Consortium, and each individual has his/her own project to use as a learning experience and as a service to the IMC - adding to the continuity and capacity built so far with VISTAs.</p>
