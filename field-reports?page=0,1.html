				<p>So it begins again. </p>
<p>My VISTA position here at Chicago Access Network Television (<a href="http://www.cantv.org" title="www.cantv.org">www.cantv.org</a>) is actually my second year as a VISTA? Why did I sign up again? Did I just enjoy living in poverty THAT much? Let's just say that the combination of public service and media work was just too tempting for me to resist. </p>
<p>Things are a bit different here at CAN TV than they were at the last organization that I served. The first, most noticeable one is its size. The Volunteer Center had only a handful of employees, and really had more VISTAs than staff. CAN TV is a medium sized organization with access to a (somewhat) steady source of income, thanks to a Chicago ordinance that mandates all cable stations in the area dedicate funds to public access television. There's quite a few more employees, and all of them have pretty concrete job responsibilities, instead of slashes (my job was marketing/communications/tech support/social media coordinator at The Volunteer Center). </p>
<p>But when you're a VISTA, some things do remain consistent. The paychecks are consistently small, no matter where you go, but that's something you adapt to. And I think that the initial period of "discovery" is always an interesting one, where you learn about the organization and they learn what you can really do for them. I'm looking forward to finding out more about CAN TV and how I can make an impact on the community through my year of service here.</p>
<p>If anyone is looking for advice from a grizzled veteran VISTA who's still out in the field, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:miketewing@gmail.com">miketewing@gmail.com</a>.</p>

	    <p>Hey Bill-</p>
<p>Last year I worked at The Volunteer Center of Northwest Suburban Chicago (or TVC, in abbreviation-speak)as a VISTA. As you may have guessed, TVC is a non-profit located in Chicago's northwest suburbs, with a service area that encompasses some 53 communities in the region. My job as a VISTA and "Communications and Outreach Coordinator" (a title I invented myself) was to help develop TVC's marketing and communications activities. As a small non-profit, they had no marketing to speak of, so I spent my time doing everything from developing their social media and redesigning their website to leading the production of a print insert in the local newspaper and press releases. Let's just say I was a little bit busy last year.</p>
<p>I found out about DASCorps through one of my late-night job searches through Google. Google really is the go-to for all the best things in life. I was really impressed to learn about DASCorps, especially since I'd been thinking of starting a similar organization myself. When I saw the position here at CAN TV, right in my backyard, I couldn't resist.</p>

	    <p>Hi Michael, I hope your first month with the Digital Arts Service Corps was better than your first month without us :-) I hope we're able to share our knowledge and community with you and better support you in your second year of service. Also, if you're interested in nerding out, I have some friends who run a community computer recycling program and they are always looking for volunteers: <a href="http://freegeekchicago.org" title="http://freegeekchicago.org">http://freegeekchicago.org</a></p>

			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p>The summer is slowly dragging by, one humid, sweltering day after the next. I guess that's what I get for living in New Orleans... In any case, these past couple of months have been really busy, so I'm excited to have a breather to contemplate my next year at the Southern Food and Beverage Museum as a DAScorps member. Let's recap...</p>
<p>For the past two months, the museum was graced with the presence<br />
of summer interns. We had one girl from Yale, another from Duke, two Tulane kids and one French girl exploring American life for the month. These interns were all ambitious and driven, meaning that while they were fun to have around, and they definitely got a lot of important things done, we also had to find enough work for them to keep them happy. I hope we accomplished this, but there were times when it seemed a little iffy. The problem is, the museum is very small, and while we have a lot of projects going on or being thought about, sometimes there's just not a lot of work to go around. Not only did I have my own work to do, but I had to try and find things for them to do! It was actually really fun, but it's kind of nice to be on my own again, knowing what's going on!</p>
<p>So I think I've worked out most of the kinks on the website--every once in a while someone will notice that a link doesn't work or that there could be a better way to navigate a page, but I think everything's just about all set. I'm going to re-check my manual and make sure it's all right, and maybe add some screen shots to help everyone out! BTW, does anyone know why Google Checkout and Wordpress don't seem to get along well? I've tried searching this, but nobody seems to have said anything about it--basically when I add a cart for a purchase on the site, and then go back to edit the site, the "add to cart" button disappears, and I have to add that code back to it. It's very strange...</p>
<p>Next on my agenda is to start bringing this Okra online magazine together. We've been talking about this for a long time, so I think it's finally time to make it all work. Hopefully I can use all these cool skills I've learned to make it look pretty and be functional! Apparently the purpose keeps changing, but I think it's going to be based on our monthly newsletter, with other articles interspersed when we want to talk about a particular subject, or add videos, whatever works. I just need to sit down with the director and Stephanie, who's in charge of it, and figure out exactly what we need.</p>
<p>I also have to get started on these kids games we're thinking of. The purpose of the games would be to help kids make healthy nutrition choices. And since I'm doing this through the museum, I also want to bring in a certain amount of cultural food discussion--like where did things come from, who's influence is this, why do we eat this particular ingredient... Considering the amount of press this particular issue has produced, this seems to be a timely issue to tackle. The question is not only how to make the games informative and fun for the kids, but also how to best reach underprivileged children who desperately need resources like this. I think reaching out to schools is the first step, but it might be a tough sell--maybe after school programs might be productive as well. New Orleans is a city certainly devoted to its food, so I think that it shouldn't be too hard to get children interested in the games as long as we can find the right place to approach them.</p>
<p>Those will be my two big projects for now, and of course I'll continue to work on the website, develop our social media program, and promote our Wiki. IN other news, the museum's having a big fundraising party this weekend, so if anyone happens to be in the New Orleans area on Sunday, feel free to stop by to taste some delicious local food and drink!</p>
<p>Good luck to all the new VISTAs! This past year of mine was wonderful, I learned a lot and I'm looking forward this coming year! </p>
<p>P.S. The new site looks awesome! Good job guys, keep up the good work!</p>

	    <p>Hey Kelsey - I'm glad new orleans is still humid and slow. Is Okra an online magazine? A food magazine I like bunch in nola is 'edible new orleans'. Do you know it? <a href="http://www.ediblecommunities.com/neworleans/" title="http://www.ediblecommunities.com/neworleans/">http://www.ediblecommunities.com/neworleans/</a></p>
<p>Thanks for the compliments on the new DASCorps website - I really like the new sofab website as well. Way better then it use to be. Capacity building!</p>

	    <p>Hey Billy! did you leave the city? I met someone who said you were heading out, but I just wanted to check. I love Edible New Orleans, we try and work together a lot, and I hope Okra will be something like it, just more about the South as a whole and cultural affairs, things like that... We'll see!<br />
Hope you're having fun wherever you are, and keep up the good work!</p>

	    <p>Hey Kelsey - Yah, I took over for Mira at the transmission project so I'm the east coast leader now...so you'll probably be hearing more from me this year. I'm visiting New Orleans at the end of this month, maybe I'll try to go by SoFAB - I wish I had made more of an effort to visit while I actually lived there.</p>

				<p>I was really happy to meet the next group of DASCorps members, if only briefly. One thing that stood out to me was the importance of documenting your achievements. It's helpful in a practical sense, having products that you can show to present and future employers. But its also important for your emotional well being as a VISTA. The year has a lot of ups and downs, and when things seem caught up in the day to day, or when projects are locked in limbo, it can be hard to remember what you've already done. Documenting my projects and accomplishments is something that I didn't do very well last year. I'm going to try to make up for it now.</p>
<p>Last summer/fall: made a video for a local basketball club, MASAE, in order to learn iMovie. Planned the org’s summer retreat. Got acquainted with the organization's yearly youth Symposium, and their community mapping project (they had a grant to develop mapping software). Went through their curriculum archives, and sat in on their Asian American Studies Workshop series.</p>
<p>Winter: reorganized the org's physical library (still in the process of the digital catalogue). Spent a lot of time building up the org's relationships with other Asian American youth groups and nonprofits. Wrote a bunch of grants that failed, and the community mapping project lost steam. Planned the org’s winter retreat.</p>
<p>Spring/Summer: coordinated the launch of a city wide Asian American youth Steering Committee. Got a grant from the city. Got my organization accepted as a summer job site. Tested my own Asian American Studies curriculum. Launched the org’s youtube site.</p>
<p>And all the while, compiling and testing stand alone workshops for high school youth, making flyers, etc.</p>

				<p>"The mission of KDHX is to build community through media, with diverse and independent voices that enrich the perspectives of our audiences."</p>
<p>Here at KDHX we're finishing up a brand-new website. It's been a year-long project, starting from surveys, research, and whiteboard brainstorms and ending up with a website that will help KDHX fulfill its mission in new ways.</p>
<p>What makes this new website great is that it takes "community through media" to a new level. It provides a new, rich medium through which KDHX DJs, programmers, and producers can deliver and add to their content. At the same time, it creates a space for people to engage with that media and continue the conversation. This means a far richer experience than a website that's just about the social aspect, just about posting media, or just has information about an organization.</p>
<p>I was really quite intimidated by the scope of the project when we started a year ago. Having been in charge of quite a few areas in which I had no background or experience, I've learned an incredible amount over the past year (probably more practical development skills than I gained in four years of college). Reading back over some email exchanges and some meeting notes from the beginning of the project reminds me of just how far we've come.</p>
<p>One of the hardest and most rewarding things we had to do actually had nothing to do with technology. KDHX encompasses a quite diverse group of people; the staff members, volunteers, DJs, producers, interns, and community members I have worked with and consulted brought a wide range of ideas, needs, and passions to the project. This variety is a huge asset to the project and the organization, but coordinating and aligning such different opinions was a challenge. We've had to make sure that everyone's opinion is heard and taken into account while keeping the resulting website from ending up as just the least common denominator of all of these inputs, and it's great to feel that we've accomplished that.</p>
<p>I'm thankful to have had the opportunity to work here with such fun people! My year as an AmeriCorps VISTA is up, but my experiences of both community and media at here at KDHX are an ongoing gift.</p>
<p>[This is actually a post I wrote for our organization's blog to sum up my year here. The new website is at next.kdhx.org!]</p>

				<p>February has been full of implementation.  We created a monthly guest lecture series to give real world examples and training to our youth media staff.  So far we have had a graphic design consultant who used to work at a local TV station, and a senior photographer for Univision, we have more in the pipes from the local NPR affiliate to web designers, post production houses and media creators.  We are using it for three current benefits: new youth staff cultivation, strategic partnerships with potential partners and, as stated before, training current youth staff with real world case studies and activities.  Because of the low attendance for the first two events we are changing the date to see if a day/ time change will increase attendance.</p>
<p>To help organize the speakers we have asked for names, experience, interactive activities, and current employment.  Additionally, we've asked for a short bio from each to help with promotional flyers.</p>
<p>Additional projects include creating the Annual Report, updating the Letterhead (both of which should be completed in the next week) and meeting a 16k goal for summer programming, which has involved creating a sponsorship packet, a list of potential donors and cover letters to each of the businesses.</p>
<p>A future project will be creating a video for promotion of the after school programming we do and designing new business cards for staff.</p>

				<p>Well, the weather has been getting nice and I've been focusing on what I want to try to get done before the end of my term at the Community Software Lab.</p>
<p>My recent work has focused mostly on creating a set of development tools to be used internally to help streamline the process of creating new development user environments to accomodate the influx of summer volunteers we just received. I took a 20 - 30 step process that spanned across a few checklists and automated it into a single command where you give the name of the development user and a few details that can't be calculated (that user's account name on launchpad.net and their primary, non-CSL email address) and it builds everything for you. Pretty slick. Right now I'm slogging through the creation of automated tests for all the subroutines in the module I created. A bit grinding but necessary.</p>
<p>On the personal front, I've continued my search for a job post-VISTA and have been to a few great meetups in the Boston area. One thing in particular I'm excited about is the upcoming New England GiveCamp on June 11th - 13th. Basically, its an event where teams of developers are put together to hack out a web application for a non-profit charity over the course of a weekend. I'm using this opportunity to improve my Drupal development skills while helping out a charity at the same time. Seriously, if you've got the weekend of the 11th free they still could use some volunteers, both technical and non-technical. Check out their website for more details: <a href="http://newenglandgivecamp.org/" title="http://newenglandgivecamp.org/">http://newenglandgivecamp.org/</a></p>
<p>Let me know if you plan on attending!</p>

				<p>Great News just came our way, here at Quote...Unquote, Inc!</p>
<p>A major part of what I have been doing, and continue to do is raise community awareness around who we are as an organization, what we do and how other organizations can partner with QUQ to further enhance community alliance &amp; promote their own organizational mission to the greater community.</p>
<p>Well, a recent endeavor I was working on for many months, along with another QUQ staffer, was to further strengthen and legitimize our newest arts, events &amp; culture channel, Encantada TV, in the growing NM filmmaker community. An outreach effort that took persistence &amp; following up on was with the NM Film Office. Seeing the NM Film Industry has been in a blossoming period, we figured what better way to get the word out about Encantada TV, to gain viewership and local film submissions was to partner with the NM Film Office.</p>
<p>Check out the update/news here on our Facebook page:<br />
http://www.facebook.com/?ref=home#!/pages/Quote-Unquote-ABQs-Public-Access-Station-Encantada-TV/154012371952</p>
<p>I am proud to say our partnership is starting off in the right direction here. Beginning on June 11th until August 29th, we will begin a summer series on Encantada TV titled "NM Filmmaker Showcase Summer Series." This is a great step in the right direction, ideally building greater alliance amongst the film &amp; media making communities here in NM.</p>
<p>I figured I would spread the love and great news with everyone. This took several months, so the moral is to never give up (i know, how cliche) and persistence really does pay off!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
Erica Jones</p>

				<p>Good news!!!!! SEDC finally has a new, permanent Board of Directors and a permanent Executive Director.  We recently got our new Board of Directors in April, and we just heard the news about the Executive Director yesterday.  Having permanent leadership will help the organization to move forward.  Basically, a lot of donors don't like to give money to an organization that doesn't have a permanent ED because that makes it look unstable.  Now that we have a permanent ED, hopefully we will be able to receive more funding.</p>
<p>Also, I have a new idea for a way that SEDC can help clients to earn some additional income.  My idea is that SEDC should open a store and sell Cambodian, Lao, Hmong, and Vietnamese items created by the clients.  SEDC can take a 10 or 15% cut (we actually have to for legal reasons), and the rest of the profit can go to the clients.  It would be kind of like the store Ten Thousand Villages that offers fair trade to people in other countries, only with people in America. I've already seen some birds they made for one of the caseworkers, Thida, and the birds are really amazing.  I'd buy one, and I think other people would, too.  I asked two caseworkers if they think their clients would want to do this, and they said yes, definitely.  </p>
<p>One caseworker, Toua, had an idea that we could have classes at SEDC where the clients teach other people how to make the birds.  He said we could charge a registration fee for the classes and use that money for SEDC's programs.  I think it's a great idea!  I plan to bring up both ideas at the next staff meeting and see what people think.  </p>
<p>The only downside to the store is who would be in charge of running it?  Would we be able to pay someone?  Would the administrative assistant be able to do her own work and run the store too?  Or maybe we could find volunteers to run it?  I will bring up these questions also at the staff meeting and see what everyone says.</p>
<p>Also, here is a link to a video I put on You Tube of a volleyball tournament:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKFPtk-B3Ow" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKFPtk-B3Ow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKFPtk-B3Ow</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, right after this game the students on the losing side tried to beat up the students on the winning side...well, we are trying to teach them good sportsmanship, but it's a work in progress!</p>

				<p>Most of these past few weeks have been about grant writing and grant research.  The hope is that we can get enough grant money to sustain our community technology program through this year and then develop more sustainable programs.</p>
<p>In the next month, I hope to focus more on putting together a business plan for more sustainable income.  I also hope to work more on fundraisers.  I'm not sure that holding huge fundraisers is the only option; I know we are way way way in the hole, but I think small fundraisers might be more realistic and would go toward building awareness of our tech/media programs as well.  What are the "best" ways to fundraise?  Is it more practical to do a bunch of small things or invest a lot in something "big?"</p>
<p>Other things... I've put some work into the community council website.  It's not the visual overhaul I've been hoping for (maybe that'll happen later) but it does have a calendar and will now have a spot for press releases.  This is important because the Little Tokyo Community Council has previously been unable to put forth "opinions" and viewpoints on key issues.</p>
<p>Looking forward to working on something besides grants.  With our Digital Literacy teacher leaving, I might be working on more curriculum development and teaching digital media to seniors (yay!).</p>

				<p>Josefina Luna is one of the kindest, warmest, friendliest women I've ever met.  We started talking one day when we were both waiting to be let into the office, before I was given my own key.  She speaks fragmented English, but it's a thousand times better than my broken Spanish.  Still, she's been nice enough to teach me Spanish words and speak slowly to me in longer sentences so that I can understand her.  </p>
<p>Yesterday, she told me the story of her life.  In the Dominican Republic (her native country), she was an accountant.  She said she focused mainly on auditing, which she loved.  She had her own car and her own apartment. </p>
<p>Then the IMF decided it was time for the Dominican Republic to pay back its debts.  The DR government didn't have the money, so it taxed middle and upper class people (Josefina was middle class).  She became impoverished, so she moved to the United States.  Here, she tried to get several accounting jobs, with no luck.  Then, she tried to work as a manager at a factory, but she was rejected as being "overqualified."  She removed her accounting experience from her resume and tried again.  This time she was hired, but as a laborer.  She had to get up at 5 a.m. to take the bus to the factory for work.</p>
<p>Now, she works at SEDC as a meal site worker.  She prepares and serves food to elderly Meals on Wheels clients who are transported to SEDC three days a week during the lunch hour.  She works only part-time, and she can't afford a car.  She needs to take a test to be certified as a public accountant in the U.S., but her English is too limited for her to score well.</p>
<p>I feel like there must be a solution somewhere, but I can't think of it.</p>
<p>Anyways, right now I'm trying to make the file of the SEDC logo larger.  It's a .jpg file now, and it has a low resolution, and I've been told that what we need is the original vector file.  If we have that file, then we can blow up the logo as big as we want on a sign, poster, etc.  Unfortunately, there's been so much staff turnover here that we have no idea who originally designed the logo.  I called a local print company, and they said they can redraw the logo for us and put it into vector form, but the charge will be $100/hour.  They estimate the time at 2-3 hours.  We can't afford to pay that, and I certainly can't redraw it myself, so I don't know what we can do.</p>
<p>Also, I'm updating the website with new events, and I wrote a new version of the newsletter describing the SEDC Cambodian and Lao New Year event in April.  I'm working on putting together an informational movie about SEDC and the work it does in the community.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have a new 15-member Board of Directors, and we should have a permanent Executive Director by the end of the month.  My supervisor is one of two candidates for the position, so I'm rooting for him, but we'll see what the Board decides.</p>

				<p>Haven't done a field report in a long time (again). The password to this thing always seems to get funky and then it gets put off until later. That's the best excuse I have at the moment.</p>
<p>CMC is just starting to get it's first email newsletter together using the civiCRM. That will go out on Wednesday if everyone gets their pieces for it in on time. In reality it'll probably go out next Monday, but I'm telling everyone to get stuff to me by Wednesday.</p>
<p>I cannot recommend CiviCRM highly enough. It's free and relatively user friendly. Although some of the admin type set up (especially for using CiviMail and having it send out email blasts) can be a bit of a headache. But it's really helped everyone at the office get all their contacts in one place so we can actually see who knows who and find them easily.</p>
<p>The budget we had for updating our Ruby on Rails site for the after school program turned out to be mostly imaginary so that site has been sitting mostly stagnant since I got here. I'm trying to learn some Ruby on Rails in between other stuff, but it's sort of on the back burner.</p>
<p>It's allergy season here and making me somewhat miserable. I had to go to the doctor the other day because my lungs were apparently only working about half as good as they were supposed to be. So they have me on some inhalers now so I can breathe again. Although I'm still sneezing and all that good stuff. Good old valley pollution. </p>
<p>I also just got myself promoted from fresh meat to Rock 'n Rolla Girl on my roller derby team (<a href="http://www.ccaderby.com/" title="http://www.ccaderby.com/">http://www.ccaderby.com/</a>). Our first bout is in June so I'm looking forward to that. I have my very own Union Jack helmet now and lots of bruises. </p>
<p>And through my derby team I've found a circus arts fire troupe and am teaching them hoop dance (they've got a fire hoop on order) and they're teaching me poi. I even got to play with some fire fans the other week.</p>
<p>I also managed to snag a low-income ticket to Burning Man! That's not until August but I'm already super excited! (Applications for low-income tickets are still open until the end of May it'd be cool to have other VISTAs there).</p>

	    <p>That's too bad that your RoR project isn't getting off the ground. I haven't used Ruby but I am currently teaching myself Django which is basically the Python equivalent and I'd love the opportunity (i.e. motivation) to work on an actual implementation.</p>
<p>Burning Man has low-income tickets!? Hmm, $160 isn't bad, but did you find any good deals for airfare? Timing could be better, considering that'll be around the time I should hopefully be starting a shiny-new, Post-VISTA job, but maybe I could postpone a few weeks to go to this...if I wasn't so broke as to need the job to pay for the trip. Oh, the cyclical dependency of my desires!</p>

				<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I hope you are all doing well and may the warmer weather be treating you kindly and hopefully not causing your body to react to unfortunate world of allergens or even to the adjustment to the change in weather. My allergies are sucking bad right now, especially considering I do not even know what is causing this discomfort out here in the South West! GO NETI POT!</p>
<p>On a positive note, my service here with Quote...Unquote, Inc could not be going better. I am re-signing my VISTA membership with QUQ, YAY! I really feel confident in the work I am executing and I have a great staff support system, which is always reassuring.</p>
<p>I also attached a nice outline/spreadsheet that our fundraiser committee developed. Please check it out &amp; provide feedback. This outline is proving itself effective as it is easier to organize which development ideas are more feasible than others. </p>
<p>Here is a list of some things I have been working on and developing (Every 2 weeks I send my boss a bi-weekly report of the things I have been doing, so it is easier to copy &amp; paste that report into the field report):</p>
<p>-Researched an effective and efficient underwriting/membership tier system to assist with the fundraising committee to develop a membership package. This model will be used by Amelia Salas, who is QUQ's Underwriting/Sales staff person. When she meets with prospective sponsors this will help with the sale.</p>
<p>-Compiled content from other staff for the creation of our monthly e-newsletter and sent it out to all subscribers (I have also created a "How To create an e-newsletter" that will be used as a guideline for it to become eventually sustainable).</p>
<p>-Mike Trujillo and I developed a contract/template to send to the NM Film Office which will help to clarify the terms in which QUQ receives programming for Encantada TV and ways to cross-promote each organization</p>
<p>-Had a meeting with Regina Chavez, Creative Albuquerque, discussing ways we can partner with eachother (cross-promotion)</p>
<p>-Had a phone meeting with Maresa Thompson from the Albuq. Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau office about them submitting programming and QUQ receiving a trade membership that would allow QUQ to get listed on their website and to send out an article in their monthly e-newsletter</p>
<p>-Meetings about the Prometheus community radio tour--helping to develop the schedule for when they visit and how their presentations will pertain to QUQ and youth</p>
<p>-Fundraiser Meeting (every Tuesday) to update eachother about grant opportunities and to develop a strategies to execute some of these funding models</p>
<p>-Met with members of Enlace Comunartio and Citizen School to discuss ways QUQ can help them with creating a youth-focused PSA about healthy vs unhealthy relationships (focusing on domestic violence within teenage relationships)</p>
<p>-Had a productive phone meeting with Anne from Miro Community to discuss how QUQ is utilizing our Community Media Space to the best of our ability with highlighting local offices (ACVB) and giving Anne feedback on the site, advice</p>
<p>-Met with members from the NM Latin Dance Festival. John Ortiz &amp; I discussed how we can help cross-promote each other. The exchange is that QUQ will work on media/videos for them and in exchange they give us advertising space</p>
<p>-Steve and I went to the NM Community Foundation website to create an organizational profile that as certain funding comes in through their office, when they do a search they match up projects with available funding. They basically have a searchable database that they use, they do not have an application.</p>
<p>-At the fundraising meeting, we delegated different grants to the members to research &amp; report back their feasibility and application to QUQ (i.e. is it worth our time to fill out the application). I will include this in my "How to Outreach &amp; Fundraise Guide."</p>
<p>-Also, Steve, Amelia and I finalized a draft for the "QUQ Annual Membership Package" which breaks down the membership into tier levels (different incentives for each category, more incentives for the "higher category"). This will hopefully be an incentive for producers to want to enhance their membership and purchase the higher of the categories. I will include this in my "How to Outreach &amp; Fundraiser Guide."</p>
<p>-Attended the in-service training/staff development for the Prometheus workshop (learning about different communication models and how to effectively construct a message to convey to a particular audience)</p>
<p>-Attended the main Prometheus event at MACCS which presented more of a media literacy 101 and how to better understand your community and their issues</p>
<p>-Sent out outreach email through a media industry listserv requesting filmmakers to submit their programs to Encantada TV, I have received a few emails indicating their willingness to submit!</p>
<p>-Worked on compiling content/articles for the newsletter (which Steve and I decided to only send out once a month)</p>
<p>-I was brainstorming ways to better promote our community media space and I came up with sending out a monthly e-bulletin titles "Community Video Showcase." This will highlight a video from our CMS and send it to everyone on our newsletter mailing list. This had a high "open" rate from our subscribers.</p>
<p>-Had a follow up meeting with Maresa Thompson, from Albuq Visitors &amp; Convention Bureau about finalizing our contract/trade agreement. QUQ will supply broll footage to ACVB and event/video coverage of the arts &amp; culture festival "Savor" in June, in exchange we get a ACVB (valued at $400) membership</p>

				<p>April was the first month with the new supervisor, and she is very cool!  She has lots of ideas for how to make community tech more sustainable and is open to hearing new ideas...so we've been researching grants and gov't contracts for short-term sustainability and making a business plan for the long-term.  And who knows, maybe we'll have a wii (SSBB? Mario Kart? ...?) tournament fundraiser sometime soon.</p>
<p>Since the last report, three network volunteers/staff have been trained to admin the wifi networks.  Recruiting at some of the buildings has been tough, but there are only 2-3 more buildings that need trained peeps.  If push comes to shove, I'll train the property managers.  The vision was always to have a resident volunteer admin the network and address resident wifi complaints...it's a lot of responsibility.  We'll see what is feasible.</p>
<p>I've also started some web design projects (redesigning the Little Tokyo Community Council website, some other stuff) so that it will be easier for the council to advocate for the community, get info out on key issues, publish press releases, etc.</p>
<p>It is weird to think that the year is almost over.  I've possibly been extended a year, so I'm trying not to panic too much about the network stuff that keeps being delayed (resident volunteers not committing, waiting on new network deployments due to gov't approval holdup...bleh).</p>

				<p>Things have been moving along out here. I'm currently in the process of developing our blog, the Idea Exchange. We've recruited bloggers and in addition to regular content, I've just started up a bi-monthly series called Introducing Our Bloggers, which allows our writers to share some information about themselves.</p>
<p>I've also created an online archive of our publications here: <a href="http://issuu.com/namac/docs" title="http://issuu.com/namac/docs">http://issuu.com/namac/docs</a></p>
<p>This is part of a bigger project to streamline our website and make it more user-friendly. I also make sure that front page is dynamic, with the graphic button changing regularly and regularly bringing in new articles.</p>
<p>I'm planning to build an Online Community Management toolkit once things with the Idea Exchange settle down a bit. I've struggled some over the past months trying to understand what exactly the role and function of an OCM is-- so I thought it would be a great way to pool resources that I've come across and add NAMAC's unique experiences to the discussion.</p>

				<p>It turns out that in Cambodia and Laos, farmers celebrate the New Year in April, right before the rainy season.  The tradition is continued in America, so at SEDC, we are having a Cambodian/Laos New Year celebration on Friday.  We also hosted a Cambodian Poetry &amp; Smot (Cambodian chanting) presentation two weeks ago, and every weekend this month, there is a celebration at either the Cambodian or the Lao temples.  I'm dressing up on Friday in a traditional Lao costume lent to me by a coworker.  </p>
<p>So I've been writing press releases and updating the SEDC website and Facebook page with information about the various New Year celebrations that are occurring throughout Rhode Island.  I'm also recording video of the different New Year celebrations to post on the SEDC website.</p>
<p>One of the press releases that I wrote stands out in my mind, so I attached it to this field report.  It's about a poetry book written by a Buddhist monk that was discovered among his possessions after he died.  The book describes his journey out of Cambodia when he was fleeing the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime.  He had to climb over a mountain, Mount Dangrek, to escape into Thailand.  Many people died on the trail because Thai soldiers pushed them off the mountain, and they fell down into a field of land mines.  Those who had silver and gold survived; they could bribe the villagers into leading them safely through the minefield.  The poor died.  </p>
<p>Seney Chang, a research assistant for the Providence City Council, told me that her sister went on the Mount Dangrek trail in her place.  She was told that her sister's body was left covered in leaves by the side of the road because there was no time to bury her.</p>
<p>We had an incredible turnout at the poetry reading.  Every seat was filled; in fact, we are beginning to outgrow our space in this building.  Two traditional Khmer (Cambodian) musicians played performed at the reading.  They traveled all the way from Cambodia to share their skill with us.  Smot, or Khmer chanting, expresses mourning and grief.  It was necessary to do this out of respect for those who died during the genocide in Cambodia.</p>
<p>This spring, I plan to open the computer lab for public use.  I also plan to organize computer classes and help with resume-building and the job search.  I hope that we will be able to take the seniors on a trip to a strawberry farm.  SEDC did this in the past, and they said it was a wonderful experience for the elders.</p>

				<p>So we're finally almost done getting this new site ready. I've been hard at work moving all the data from our old site to the new platform. I've gotten a chance to make the data more relevant and less wordy for the most part than it was--a lot of the stuff we had was from when the museum first opened in 2004!<br />
After that's up and running, then I'll be able to focus more on the Wiki page. I'm working with one of the museum's interns to create new pages and keep it interesting, and we're going to start really marketing it on the new site and on social media sites. We're thinking of changing the name to something a little cooler than wiki, but we're not sure where to go with that quite yet...<br />
The best and worst part of New Orleans is the mess of events that go on throughout the city, especially in the spring. They're always a lot of fun to go to, but it really detracts from our visitors and participants in programs because it seems like nobody wants to be inside at our events when there are so many outdoor activities. I think our location is partly to blame as well, but I feel like I'm not doing a good enough job of helping to market the museum. I know that's not really my job, but I feel somewhat responsible at the same time....<br />
Besides this, not too much has been going on. Pondering next year, which I don't want to do, but it looks like it's coming up soon! I'm still a little upset that it took this long to get the new website put together because of our former web-designer. I feel like if I had known that he wasn't going to be able to finish it in a timely manner, I would have taken my own steps to work on a new platform. But that being said, I'm glad I have the help of a competent graphic designer and someone who knows exactly how to make everything look professional. I think at my level of computers, it would not have looked as good as it will now.<br />
Well I have to get back to work and keep up on these tasks. I'm going to a talk tomorrow about emerging technologies, so hopefully I'll learn something new and useful! Hope everyone else is doing well and enjoying themselves! As soon as we've got everything working, I'll put up a link to our new site, but here's the basic thing now: <a href="http://sofab.thinkhacks.net/" title="http://sofab.thinkhacks.net/">http://sofab.thinkhacks.net/</a>.
