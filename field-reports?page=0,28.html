				<p> About once a month we have a brown-bag lunch discussion here at the San Francisco Non-Profit Tech Center, in which we send out a general invitation to the Bay Area&#39;s NPO community.  We usually get half a dozen or so, which makes for a pretty good discussion.  On Wednesday, we had a discussion about Boards.  </p>
<p>I won&#39;t go into too much detail here, but we have a wiki for our discussions if you&#39;re interested. </p>
<p><a href="http://nonprofitoperations.aspirationtech.org/index.php/January_31%2C_2007-Board_Development_and_Recruitment" title="http://nonprofitoperations.aspirationtech.org/index.php/January_31%2C_2007-Board_Development_and_Recruitment">http://nonprofitoperations.aspirationtech.org/index.php/January_31%2C_20...</a> </p>
<p>I didn&#39;t participate much, since I haven&#39;t had much experience in this area, other than my experience with Aspiration&#39;s board in December.   It was interesting to see how our board interacts with Heather and Gunner, and how they provide us with support and advice.  We have a really good board who are hands-on but not too much.  At the brown bag, I heard a few stories about boards that essentially micromanage, and others that provide financial support (as in, $10,000/year is required from each board member).  We don&#39;t have either of those dynamics at work in Aspiration, and I think our model works well for us. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also been working on an Advisory Committee for Social Source Commons, which is a &quot;board&quot; of sorts.  Basically, we&#39;re trying to pull in the expertise of people from a variety of NPO&#39;s to help give advice for SSC.  We&#39;re hoping for some good advice for the site as well as data as far as what tools they use and recommend.  I&#39;m pretty much in charge of running this, so any advice is helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> It&#39;s also interesting that we got a Board Management tool entered into SSC in the past week called <a href="http://www.boardtrax.net/">BoardTrax</a>.  Does anyone use this, or any other &quot;board-management&quot; software?  I&#39;m thinking of testing it out for the purposes of the aforementioned advisory committee.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone has any experience or advice in dealing with boards or committees of this nature, please let me know. </p>

				<p>I feel it is important to have a deep, full understanding of a problem before you go about finding solutions to it. Since I will be focusing on Digital Divide issues and suggesting solutions for them, I need to know precisely what the <em>Digital Divide</em> refers to before I do anything.</p>
<p>What does the <em>Digital Divide</em> mean? Why does it matter? To whom or what does it refer to? How does the divide close? How would you know when its closed? What does the solution(s) look like? How can you tell if a solution is appropriate for a specific geographical area? How do you measure the successes or failures of a solution? Does the Digital Divide only apply to people or to organizations as well? What kind of people does the Digital Divide target? What kind of organizations?</p>
<p>I dont think it does any good trumpeting statistics that demonstrate low levels of computer literacy among the poor and under-privileged. Bottom line: computers are a luxury item. Theres no getting around that. Its a hard sell, and giving out computers willy-nilly to people who dont know how to use them in the first place just will not work. You just dont need a computer to be successful, happy, or give back to your community.</p>
<p>The Digital Divide does matter, but I feel there needs to be a consensus as to what exactly it refers to and how to best solve it. As I stand right now, the Digital Divide means the difference of communication-technology skillsets between the most adept users and all the rest. The name <em>Digital Di</em>vide implies &#39;haves&#39; and &#39;have nots&#39;, but in reality the Digital Divide is more like a pyramid. There are those at the top who actually engineer and advance communication technology, those in the middle who know how to effectively manuever the technology, those in the bottom who have little to no technological ability, and then those at the absolute bottom who are lost to us. To extend the pyramid metaphor, the point is not to bridge the divide but to square it so that everyone is at the same level.</p>
<p>The <em>Digital Divide</em> is a problem, but it is crucial that the problem of unequal communication-technology skillsets be framed appropriately. The term <em>Digital Divide</em> implies a means-to-an-end and not the end itself because technology is viewed as a way to introduce equality rather than being equality itself. This is a wrongheaded approach. Discussions on the Digital Divide need to be focused on issues of social inequality not technological inequality; access to public resources not access to computers; overall skillsets and abilities not just computer literacy; etc. When framed in this manner the Digital Divide becomes much bigger, much more socially relevant, and given its just importance. Computer literacy is a means to an end (this is a fact!), but it must be sold as an end if Digital Divide solutions are to be successfully initiated.</p>
<p>To solve the Digital Divide (or the Digital Pyramid to rid myself of the misleading alliterative term) means introducing skillsets, giving computers and free internet access to those who would actually benefit from it (preferably after successfully completing a free computer-literacy program), and enhancing non-profit capacity building and effectiveness through communication technology. If I could prioritize these, I would say non-profit capacity building is by far the most important as they touch more lives as a whole and conform to the social equality value more directly. Then followed by introducing computer skillsets through after-school programs because they touch far less lives but still conform to the social equality value. Finally, the giving out of computers and free internet because of the high cost associated with giving out computers to people and the even less amount of lives touched. </p>
<p>Alright, I feel better after that.</p>

	    <p>Hey Kevin,</p>
<p>Great musings for a new CTC VISTA!  The whole "digital divide" movement is rich with all these questions and conflicts.  I'd suggest you check out the writing of Henry Jenkins at MIT (<a href="http://www.henryjenkins.org/">http://www.henryjenkins.org/</a>) - he's been talking about how there's no longer a digital divide (which I disagree with myself) but now it's a "participation gap", which sounds close to what you're getting at.  I'd agree that the work needs to be less about just getting people access to technology, but giving them the skills and value to using it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm definitely thinking this would be a great part of the next Digest.</p>

	    <p>Hey, Kevin, Danielle&#39;s given me a heads up about your post and since I&#39;m in the middle of writing some funding inquiries for the project and how we contribute to &quot;bridging the digital divide,&quot; looks like it&#39;d be useful for me to check out your post to see what new highways and by-ways it points to.</p>
<p>…and a good post it is.  The way you begin your penultimate paragraph is right on, and your final conclusion is a great reward.  Lots of really good questions.  Let me offer just a couple of contributions to the topic and check back in down the line to see how it&#39;s going.</p>
<p>The founder of all of this, Antonia Stone, who began the Playing to Win computer literacy and training program for prisoners and ex-offenders back in 1981, the Playing to Win community computing center in a public housing basement in east Harlem in 1983, the Playing to Win Network, PTWNet, which grew into CTCNet--she saw way back when that computers would become a basic social tool and that those without access to them and the education and training to use them effectively would become further alienated and disenfranchised from our basic culture and resources and that have-have not divisions would deepen into even greater social antagonisms with major social and political repercussions.  A lot of that is reflected quite explicitly in the original PTW creed as it was developed in the 80&#39;s and carried into the 90&#39;s and 21st century.  See, for instance, <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/winter-spring-1998/r981miss.htm:" title="www.comtechreview.org/winter-spring-1998/r981miss.htm:">www.comtechreview.org/winter-spring-1998/r981miss.htm:</a></p>
<p>&quot;Community Technology Centers&#39; Network (CTCNet) envisions a society in which all people are equitably empowered by technology skills and usage. CTCNet is committed to achieving this end.</p>
<p>&quot;CTCNet shares with Playing To Win, its founding organization, a recognition that, in an increasingly technologically dominated society, people who are socially and/or economically disadvantaged will become further disadvantaged if they lack access to computers and computer-related technologies.</p>
<p> &quot;CTCNet brings together agencies and programs that provide opportunities whereby people of all ages who typically lack access to computers and related technologies can learn to use these technologies in an environment that encourages exploration and discovery and, through this experience, develop personal skills and self-confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;CTCNet offers resources to enhance each affiliated agency/program&#39;s capacity to provide technology access and education to its constituency and to help and nurture other like-minded programs in its area. CTCNet will facilitate telecommunications, print, and in-person linkages enabling members to benefit from shared experience and expertise.</p>
<p>&quot;CTCNet will be a leading advocate of equitable access to computers and related technologies; it will invite, initiate, and actively encourage partnerships and collaborations with other individuals and organizations that offer resources in support of its mission; and it will strive, in every arena, to bring about universal technological enfranchisement.&quot;</p>
<p>Toni and CTCNet people did not invent the phrase &quot;digital divide,&quot; but that&#39;s what the organization and the movement spoke to through the 90&#39;s as the phrase picked up currency during the latter years of the Clinton-Gore administration.  It was a &quot;Digital Divide&quot; Request for Proposal (RFP) that the Corporation for National and Community Service issued in the spring of 2000 that led to the establishment of the CTC VISTA Project, the anti-poverty missions of VISTA and CTCNet coming together in the effort we are all involved with now.</p>
<p>Even then the phrase &quot;digital divide&quot; was starting to lose its currency and popularity, not only among those who tried to minimize the problem and say it no longer existed, but also among many of the strongest proponents of CTC programs and efforts that sought to provide greater technology resources and capacities for the entire nonprofit sector.  The argument, so it goes, is that the phrase originated from the side of the &quot;haves&quot; and reflects neither the experience nor the understanding of the &quot;have-nots&quot; but rather a characteristic problematic we-have-the-knowledge-and-tools upper, upper-middle class patronizing attitude.  In many quarters the phrase &quot;digital opportunities&quot; program has come to be used in its place.  I personally value the phrase &quot;digital divide&quot; as it is one of the few expressions in public discourse that carries with it the sense that there are deep social divisions we need to address.</p>
<p>There&#39;s much more to be said in response to your set of questions--this seems like a good amount for now. -----peter  </p>

	    <p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>I think it is important that the issues regarding the technologically under-served and under-educated be revisited, renamed, and reconceptualized every so often just to make the issue fresh and exciting to would-be funders. Otherwise <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/reports/anol/NationOnlineBroadband04.htm">this</a> to happens.</p>
<p>The term &quot;digital divide&quot; carries weight because its simple, self-explanatory, and familiar. However, it is limited by its staleness; it evokes oversimplified solutions; and the term has become associated with superfluous <a href="http://www.consumerfed.org/pdfs/digitaldivide.pdf">luxury.</a> Eveything has its pluses and minuses, I guess.</p>

				<p>Yes.  I&#39;m still here.  I&#39;ve been incredibly busy.  The past few months have been packed with activity.  Our organization is going through a major period of growth and reorganization, and we&#39;ve all been working hard on getting that straightened out.  There&#39;s also been a lot of work trying to obtain a) more funding, and b) sustainable funding.  So there&#39;s been a fair amount of grant writing and other pursuits.  Additionally, we&#39;ve been upgrading our IT infrastructure and pushing out new software releases of our community networking software, which has entailed a lot of testing, debugging, and coding.</p>

				<p>I have been having some difficulty explaining my role as a vista and or CTC vista at my organization.  Some of the people working there have ideas of what my job will be that do not fit the vista work description at all.  Last night I attended a meeting and typed up what a Vista is, what a CTC Vista is, and my role in the organization; some people still seemed confused.  Does anybody have any suggestions on how they introduced them selves and made it clear to everyone what there role is in their organization?  I also, mentioned that my part is to capasity build and to make their programs better and stronger.  I know that I will probably have to do direct service, but i need to make it clear that my role is so much more than that. </p>

<p>Mmmm sorry to hear you're struggling.  Was your supervisor(s) any help?  Can you make the conference call today at 2pm?  It might be a great time to ask some other digital media VISTAs who are working at afterschool centers.</p>
<p>If you can't call in today, I'll give you a call next week.</p>

				<p>Imagine if you could run Windows XP, Mac OS X, and multiple versions of Linux on the same computer.  That&#39;s already a reality--you just have to reboot to switch between them.  Now imagine that you could run all these operating systems at the same time on the same computer.  You could run MS Word 2003 at the same time you&#39;re running Safari, all while programming in Eclipse.  It&#39;s possible.  The technology that makes it possible: Xen.</p>
<p>Xen is a virtualization technology that&#39;s based on Linux.  It lets you run multiple virtual computers (&quot;guest&quot; operating systems) on top of one master operating system (called the &quot;host&quot; OS).  In other words, you can run Windows and Linux on the same PC at the same time.</p>
<p>That&#39;s the sexy use, anyhow.  Xen&#39;s already in use by hosting companies to give customers their own computer.  Instead of having to give customers a physical PC, Xen allows the hosting companies to fit many virtual computers onto one PC.  If the customers don&#39;t need much computing power, why not?</p>
<p>At the Community Software Lab, we&#39;re in the process of putting together a Xen-based server so that we can emulate our current network of servers from within one machine.  Instead of having to prepare a new computer to become a server--install hard drives, memory, network cards, cd-rom drives, load the OS via cd-rom--we can type a few commands on the Xen server and have a working virtual computer in about five minutes.  What once took a day to do now takes minutes.</p>
<p>The kinks?  The Xen server has to share its memory among many virtual computers, and these days, people&#39;s personal computers use 256 MiB, 512 MiB, 1 GiB, or more.  This puts a limit to the number of virtual computers that can fit onto one host machine.</p>
<p>We&#39;re working the kinks out of our test server (now running computation-friendly virtual machines), and as soon as we hear from our server supplier, we&#39;ll be putting together the production server. </p>
<p>Computer virtualization is nothing new, however.  IBM&#39;s been doing it in their mainframes for over 40 years.  VMWare is a widely-used virtualization product.  Various video-game emulators have been around for a while (I beat Rygar using good ol&#39; Nesticle, all while surfing the web).  Xen just seems most promising for the moment.</p>
<p>I would be remiss in my duties if I didn&#39;t mention KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine--not Keyboard, Video, Mouse!).  New in the 2.6.20 Linux kernel (the core of the operating system that handles memory management, task switching, networking, etc.), KVM might give Xen a run for its money.  I&#39;ll try it out, but with time invested in Xen, that&#39;s where we&#39;re headed for the moment. </p>

				<p>My oldest sister, Pat - Patricia Ann Shelton, just died this past week.</p>
<p>She was my favorite sister, who looked out<br />for me as though I was her son.</p>
<p>This followed the very recent death of her husband.</p>
<p>They were my lifeline here in the pacific northwest.</p>
<p>If I wanted to share a laugh or ask for help, they were<br />there for me.</p>
<p>They have left behind two sons - both in their mid<br />40s and my sister has left behind two brothers and<br />two sisters who loved her very much and who will<br />miss her.</p>
<p>I lost a good friend with whom I could share the not<br />so occasional sick joke.</p>
<p>There will be a hole in my life and my heart where she<br />once was and a lifetime of memorable moments.</p>
<p>This past year was filled with pain for her, time in<br />and out of the hospital, and in an assisted living<br />facility, which required her to give up precious<br />freedom and independence. Her life had<br />degraded to better living through chemistry and<br />an assortment of pills and dosages which required<br />a chart of several pages to keep straight.</p>
<p>No one should have to live like that - if you can<br />begin to call that living.</p>
<p>She is now in a better place, pain free. Hopefully<br />reunited with her husband.</p>
<p>For that, I am glad.</p>
<p>I would not have wished her alive, if the year to<br />come meant a year identical to the year just past.</p>
<p>I do not wish that kind of, quality of life on anyone.</p>
<p>Take care.</p>

				<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>Ive made it to Miami alright. It took a long drive from Michigan, but it was well worth it. I was scared my car wouldn&#39;t hold up because it had 220,000 miles on it before the trip started, but like a trooper it soldiered on through Appalachia, the Carolinas, and I-95 South. Honda makes a good car.</p>
<p>The Collins Center was surprised to see me so early as they were expecting me next week, but they were nonetheless happy to see me and have been very helpful. Im still looking for a place to live and get settled in, but that should only take a couple days to get finalized. My supervisor has been really nice and has allowed me to stay at his place in the meantime. </p>
<p>Ive already spent a few hours in meetings with the Collins Center Staff and others who Id be working with and they all seem very enthusiastic and outgoing. Im looking forward to the next year. </p>

	    <p>How very exciting that you have made friends with the reptiles in the area!  I would say catch one and keep it as a pet, but mayhap taking some pictures and posting them would be a much better idea! ^_^  Unless you want to ship a pet lizard out to Wisconsin so I can have a pet!... :) :)</p>
<p> Also, let me know if you have an AIM name or a gmail address... I chatted with Karl on AIM the other day, quite fun!</p>

				<p><span>On Monday, January 8, 2007, the TANs took the time to gather for our monthly conference call.<span>  </span></span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Cheryl entertained us with an informative and interesting presentation on Disaster Recovery Planning.  An issue applicable to anyone and everyone, she told us what a disaster recovery plan is, why to have one, and gave us a step-by-step guide to creating one!</span><span> </span> </p>
<p><span>Next it was time for Best of/Worst of for December/early January.<span>  </span>Here’s what people had to say!</span><em><span> </span></em></p>
<p><em><span>Best thing that happened:</span></em><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim</span></strong><span> – He enjoyed his time off during the holidays.<span>  </span>In addition, he took advantage of the opportunity to sit in on a board meeting for his organization, which he found interesting.<span>  </span>Way to learn new things!</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kamala</span></strong><span> – Kamala also enjoyed her vacation and took time to spend time with her family.<span>  </span>Work-related, she has been testing databases, which she enjoys.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Karl</span></strong><span> – Karl spent his vacation time in Seattle with his family, and we all know spending time with your family during the holidays is a plus.<span>  </span>Work-wise, he’s been spending time cleaning up the database and making it user-friendly.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Andrea</span></strong><span> – She successfully completed her EMT classes!<span>  </span>Congrats, Andrea!</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Laura</span></strong><span> – Laura also enjoyed her vacation time, splitting her time between being with her family in Indiana and seeing friends in Kentucky.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Corey</span></strong><span> – Corey got new Taebo videos!<span>  </span>Now she and Laura can spend their mornings getting fit…and waking up the people who live under them. :)</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cheryl</span></strong><span> – Cheryl has taken the initiative to join an organization and meet new people!<span>  </span>She attended a pot-luck meal, which was quite enjoyable.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>
<p><em><span>Worst thing that happened:</span></em><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim</span></strong><span> – A lot was waiting for him when he returned to work from his vacation.<span>  </span>Getting caught up on things is never fun, unless you like that sort of thing (which he does not).</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kamala </span></strong><span>– Her home computer crashed.<span>  :(</span></span><span><span>  </span>‘Nuff said.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Karl</span></strong><span> – He doesn’t think that getting caught up when returning from vacation is much fun either.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Andrea</span></strong><span> – Despite the fact that she just finished her EMT classes, she’s been battling being sick.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Laura</span></strong><span> – See her blogs <em><a href="node/359.html" target="_blank">Unnecessary (?) adventures</a></em> and <em><a href="node/362.html" target="_blank">Unnecessary (?) adventures – Part II</a></em>.<span>  </span>Being sick and taking SevenCorners into account when trying to receive services is no picnic.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Corey</span></strong><span> – Her car got mysteriously scratched….and it’s leased, so she has to get it fixed so she’s not fined when her lease is up.<span>  </span>That’s not easy on a VISTA budget.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cheryl</span></strong><span> – One day she was carrying her backpack, and she noticed that her food-containing tupperware dish leaked all over everything.<span>  </span>What a mess!</span><span> </span> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Our next call is scheduled for 2/2/2007 at 4:00pm EST/1:00 PST.<span>  </span>Until then, be good, stay warm, and keep on keeping on!!</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Random question of the month</strong> (added by Laura): How do you create <em>your</em> smileys? Do they face left? (: or do they face right? :)  In addition, are you right- or left-handed?  I wonder if there&#39;s a correlation between which direction you make your smileys and which hand you write with.</span></p>

	    <p>Definitely like this:   :) (which I believe is to the left?)</p>
<p>I am right-handed. </p>
<p>However, I am also goofy-footed and shoot pool left handed, so maybe I am the exception to whatever conclusions come from this survey :). &lt;--see</p>

	    <p>my answers: right and right. </p>
<p>i think left smilies are more often from people who strongly value uniqueness, and that is a trait i have sometimes noticed in lefties (to make themselves feel special? :p ).</p>
<p>i think some people would have been left handed if they weren&#39;t forced into being righies by our right-hand world, so maybe the lefties who we see as lefties (as opposed to the suppressed lefties) are the ones who are less influenced by outside factors and so are also more likely to express their nontraditional smiley directions (left being the nontraditional direction - since we read/write left-right top-bottom, and eyes are before mouth top-bottom they should be typed that way when going left-right).</p>
<p>however, we (at least those in our age group) were older on average when making smiley &quot;choices&quot; than when making hand &quot;choices&quot; so maybe different factors would influence these decisions.</p>
<p>also i have seen left smileys  develop as a reaction to chat programs that by default automatically make right but not left smileys into icons.</p>
<p>can you tell i&#39;m putting off some work i don&#39;t really want to do? guess i&#39;ll get to it now though.

				<p>Nearing the end of week one......dang. Is anyone else feeling overwhelmed and like their brain is fried?  So much information and trying to process it all is taking its toll.  Hope everyone is enjoying themselves and finding out that their position is everything they hoped it would be.  I am enjoying myself and getting more and more excited about all of the things that need to be accomplished.  But its a slow start. Off for now.</p>

<p>I felt the same way last Friday evening. Good Grief! How are things going this week? </p>
<p>For me, this week is making a little more sense. It&#39;s already mid-week and there is still a lot more to do before Friday. </p>

				<p>Hi Gang,</p>
<p>It&#39;s Wednesday afternoon. The past few days were filled with orientations and meetings and signing up adult learners and meeting with tutors, both new and the ones that&#39;s been with MCL for a while.</p>
<p>There&#39;s lots to process and I have another meeting in just a little while. But I wanted to give an update. So far all is well, I get to improvise, create, and not panic...much.</p>
<p>Take care all. I will write again in a few days.</p>

<p>I noticed you were listed as needing a roommate for the NTEN conference... I have a room reserved, but I know it&#39;s just a king sized bed... do you have one reserved for two beds?  If one of us has a potential two-person room, would you like to be roommates?  Let me know!</p>

	    <p>Catherine,</p>
<p>I have reserved a room with two beds. Of course we could be roommates. My information is posted at the website, give me a call and we can make arrangements. I told my supervisor about your interest in sharing a room earlier this week. All that&#39;s left is to confirm. </p>
<p>Thanks for getting in touch with me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>

<p>Who would&#39;ve thunk that helping to integrate new software<br />would involve reading contracts?</p>
<p>(Next best thing to sleeping pills)</p>

<p> From their website:</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.elcentrodelazaza.com" title="http://www.elcentrodelazaza.com">http://www.elcentrodelazaza.com</a></p>
<p align="justify"> &quot;El Centro de la Raza&quot; is best translated from the Spanish as &quot;The Center of the People.&quot; From the beginning, those who occupied and began to transform the old elementary school were joined by hundreds of previous allies of different races and economic sectors who identified with the purpose. Like the surrounding neighborhood, and Seattle as a whole, they represented the rainbow of humanity. </p>
<p align="justify">So, although the founding of El Centro de la Raza was sparked by Latinos and acquired a Spanish name, it began, and remains, &quot;The Center of the People.&quot; It is &quot;home&quot; for all people who are interested in making a better and more just world in which, to borrow from Dr. King, &quot;People are judged by the content of their character and not the color of their skin.&quot; El Centro de la Raza provides a community &quot;plaza,&quot; or center for Seattle area&#39;s otherwise dispersed, and in 1972, largely invisible Latino community. El Centro de la Raza receives all individuals with open arms.&quot;</p>
<p align="justify">Taking pix there too, will post after they&#39;re developed.</p>
<p align="justify">(Hope to get a digital cam with first paycheck - then, even more pix will follow)</p>
<p> Watched a vid and a presentation on the origins of El centro de la Raza<br />as well as on Chicano / Latino History in the  Pacific NW.</p>
<p>Interesting. </p>

				<p>So whats been going on at CTOC (community technology organizing consortium) since I started my Vista-ship back in November? Well, from November to the beginning of January I spent a lot of the time doing outreach for a Holiday event we held. That turned out to be a bit of a flop on attendance and I did feel like a bit of a failure to my organization but I got over it. I realized the causes of low attendannce were various...new event location, holiday season, etc. It was my first few weeks on the job so I wasn&#39;t too hard on myself. As soon as that was over we got a call from CTCNet to help with outreach for the Los Angeles institutes, as they were lacking in registration.  So the week and a half long tasks of phone calls, e-mails, and e-vites began again. This turned out to be much much better. The CTCNet institute was quite interesting and informative. Unlike many of the CTCVista&#39;s I lack in being &quot;tech savvy&quot; so I never realized the capabilities of various software components and its ability to provide access to the disabled.  </p>
<p> Amidst outreach calls and two events, I spent a lot of time reading up on broadband/technology  issues - policies, capacity, its effects on society as a whole - and wow have I learned a whole lot about the need to address the various issues surroundung this! My supervisor has been great in sharing her knowledge with the issues- she really knows her stuff and has helped me a lot. I also work alongside ex-vista Sheveeta once a week so I&#39;d have to  say that I&#39;ve got pretty good support going on here.  </p>
<p>This week I&#39;ve started some research on the broadband debate. I think I am going to be doing a mini-analyses on where the issue lies now and the importance of CTOC&#39;s position as a community and social advocate. Hopefully this will help us land some grants later on as we are lacking in funding as well. </p>
<p> <strong>If anyone has any leads as to where I can access reading material for my research i.e policies, debates, books, etc,</strong>  that would be awesome. I seem to be only finding U.K websites that cover the issue in depth. </p>
<p> To summarize, I&#39;ve done outreach for two events, familiarized myself with technology as a whole,  thinking of ways to fundraise, and starting a mini research project, as well as manning the admin side to our office from time to time. </p>
<p> I really hadn&#39;t felt like I was doing a whole lot but now that I&#39;ve written it all down I feel a little overwhelmed! : ) All good nontheless.  </p>

	    <p>Hi Dana-</p>
<p>Here&#39;s some starting points about broadband.  Hope it leads you in the right direction.</p>
<p>PBS program on Net Neutrality (you may already know about it) - <a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/moyersonamerica/net/index.html" target="_blank" title="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/moyersonamerica/net/index.html">http://www.pbs.org/moyers/moyersonamerica/net/index.html</a>   You can watch the whole program or just the parts that interest you (look for the subheadings).  There are also a lot of documents at <a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/moyersonamerica/net/documents.html" target="_blank" title="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/moyersonamerica/net/documents.html ">http://www.pbs.org/moyers/moyersonamerica/net/documents.html </a></p>
<p>At the Media Reform conference, there were at least 2 panels that may be relevant - one on wireless internet networking and another on the digital divide.  Look for the audio recordings on the conference site: <a href="http://www.freepress.net/conference/=full_schedule07" target="_blank" title="http://www.freepress.net/conference/=full_schedule07">http://www.freepress.net/conference/=full_schedule07</a></p>
<p>And if you&#39;re looking for academic research or even newspaper/magazine articles, check into seeing if your local library has access to research databases such as EBSCO, Academic Search Premiere, or Lexis Nexus, any sort of periodical or research database.    If you&#39;re at the library website, it would be under research page or something like that.  Or find a friend who is going to school and has access to those databases.   </p>

(See the old <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/organizations.php?org_id=210">project description</a>).  </p>
<p>Here&#39;s a bit of info from the presentation:  </p>
<p>In 2005, 292 residents (over 750 families in the last four years) took advantage of technology training and computer skills classes.  </p>
<p>In 2003, Madison received $70K Cisco grant to construct a pilot FREE wireless network Cisco Systems provided hardware for the WiFi system, including bridges, access points, antennas and client adapters Madison provides as a pilot free 802.11b wireless Internet access to the residents of Madison Park Village.  Madison provides free Cisco Aironet 350 series wireless cards for residents. With either the standard omnidirectional antenna or a higher-gain flat panel antenna is used with the client cards. </p>
<p>With this project residents of Madison Park Village now have access to enormous personal opportunities that would have otherwise remained out of reach.</p>
