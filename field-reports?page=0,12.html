				<p>So I'm down here in Miami, talk about hot or should I say blazen every day has been 90 degrees or hotter I 'm not sure why I even look at the weather channel. Yesterday was my one month anniversary. I have had the pleasure of working between two organizations The Collins Center for Public Policy and YeTech (Youth Expressions Technology Center) I am a split Vista the other chick didn't show so I'm doing work for two people. At first I thought it was the best of both worlds but now I'm praying many times a day to keep my sanity. I've come to realize that some people here have unrealistic expectations of how to increase capcity and get grant money. </p>
<p>The Collins Center is my main source of resources they have quite cubicals, air conditioning, phone, internet, and printers. YeTech has non of thee above but they need mad resources and grant money. Question: How am I going to do research and build capcity for them with out a phone or internet? </p>
<p>After doing a community needs assesment I was ready to work I figure that I would use The Collins Center to do that since they all work together. Jokes on Loveta...that is sort of hard to do. So I have a co-worker Post Vista who got hired on after her year of service to show me the ropes..</p>
<p>What people do with a little bit of power? So its like I am the servant I do stuff that has been past due for four 4 months. Might I add that I have only been a Vista for 1 month and a day..So my first mind is whose problem is that. But I am not that assertive or disrespectful I have a little bit of tact.</p>
<p> I love to help but being pressured to meet deadlines that are past due isn't my style of work. Mean while I (we, me and her) travel to many other community organizations daily doing communtiy needs assesments and tech atlas.  Oh yeah using my car and I get 10 dollars for the tank if I show frustration.(Ooooh)<br />
Now if I didn't drive my "HOOT RIDE" 1200 miles then how would we get to the community organizations?  Mean while you have the Supervisor whom I've only seen twice telling me that I should sell my car to cut down on expenses. That sounds realistic to someone who comes from a middle class background who has lots of support.  But not for me you know one of those "Poor People" we wanna help to overcome poverty and besides I won't be able to effectively do my job in the community.</p>
<p>So I do alot of traveling though out Miami that includes all parts and all under served communities. I sort of like though because by me not being from here I am being exposed to alot all the different kinds of people different languages all of the free lunch dates at expensive resturants (these people are sort of like CTC they will feed you and only the best foods)</p>
<p>Oooh I almost forgot yesterday I met with one of the biggest local funders of the community can you believe that? It's like being behind the scene of non-profts and guess what they loved me. They liked what I said and they are looking forward to working with me and showing the rope. As a matter a fact we have a meeting Tuesday at 1:00pm Can you believe that? I knew it was a good meeting because at the end the wealthy funder the woman gave me a hug and one of those smooches kisses on my cheek. They looked really cool and fun to look at the guy reminds me of Ben with the stylish button, jeans, and chucks. The woman was professional but sort of rock starish kinda like Nickey. So I blended right in with them the Executive director I attended the meeting with was  nervous and shaky. I on the other hand was calm and cool. I didn't even sweat.</p>
<p>I started classes at Miami Dade College for grant writting and I am learning alot. Also while visting a non-profit we were asked if we were Techies post-vista said no we are not. I said what do you need help with they lady's printer wouldn't print so all I did was add the printer for her I showed her what to do it was so simple. It was then I realized that digital literacy is a very important factor in reducing the digital divide.</p>
<p>So far this has been one experience thats priceless I'm looking forward to the next 11 months of kaos.</p>
<p>I don't suffer from insanity; I enjoy every minute of it.</p>

			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p>Down here in Austin, TX it’s been hot and crazy.  When I arrived at the Mobile Film School, I learned that we were planning our first annual fundraiser for Aug. 9th.  “The Mobile Film School Bowl-a-Rama,” was held in a biergarten and historic six-lane bowling alley.  Companies put teams together to bowl in the historic alley where free drinks and food were readily available, while general admission played Wii Bowling, listened to live music, and munched on BBQ.   The two full-time employees of the Mobile Film School came up with this idea a mere 7-weeks before the event was set to take place.  So, we were on the fast track to a really big event with a really small staff.<br />
 In order to do my part in helping get this event off the ground, I needed to jump in quickly.  I began where their previous graphic designer left off.  Ideally, I would have started a month earlier and conceived all of the ideas myself, but I had to start with the logo and flyer he designed and make the rest of the event a seamless match.   After countless emails to our sponsors begging for EPS files, I was on my way to designing my first large signs.  Begging for files turned out to be the easiest part, as I was about to get my first lesson in large corporation communication.<br />
 One large printing company, that shall remain nameless was horrible to deal with.  Although the event has already passed, I’m still receiving emails about filling out the proper legal documents to use their logo.  (Not to mention the only reason we used their logo was because they gave us a discount, so we in turn wanted to promote them)  This nameless company also printed large orders late, wrong, and lost files.<br />
 However, my time here has been fun.  It was great to get so involved in an event and get to see the results so quickly.  ‘Till next time…</p>

			 	<a href="node/1322.html" title="Month 1: Working the Working Groups at the UCIMC" rel="bookmark"><h1>Month 1: Working the Working Groups at the UCIMC</h1></a>
			 				 	
			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p>The over-arching goal of my first month of VISTA service has been to understand and coordinate the efforts of the many “working groups” that comprise my host organization, the <a href="http://www.ucimc.org/">Urbana-Champaign Independent Media Center (UC-IMC)</a>.  The UC-IMC is a grassroots organization in the <a href="http://www.indymedia.org/en/index.shtml">IndyMedia</a> network committed to using media production and distribution as tools for promoting social and economic justice in the Champaign County area.  The UC-IMC is a unique non-profit that has many resources but no staff – it is a collective of passionate and talented volunteers who help maintain and provide tools and spaces for independent media creation in a great historic post-office building that includes a stage, radio station, computer lab, production studios, art studios, library, and meeting spaces.  These volunteers make it all function by organizing into working groups that focus on one area of community interest or media expertise – so there is a <a href="http://shows.ucimc.org/">Shows</a> group for live events and stage shows; a Print group that publishes an independent newspaper, the <em><a href="http://publici.ucimc.org/">Public i</a></em>; a radio group that runs <a href="http://www.wrfu.net/">WRFU 104.5FM</a>; a Tech group; Web group; and many others.  Everything is based on consensus decision-making, some volunteers have more time than others, and some groups are larger and more active than others, so things are vital and creative but loosely organized.</p>
<p>In this framework of total independence and intentional self-organization, Nicole Pion and I as VISTAs are the only actual staff at the IMC.  As such, the challenges we have faced during our first month are improving the effectiveness of each group in its media and social outreach projects while also getting those groups to work together rather than separately, and balancing our own time between staffing the building on a daily basis and planning long-term social tech projects.  It is demanding and rewarding work, and I greatly benefit from collaborating with Nicole, who is bringing non-profit and outreach experience and a keen social organizing perspective, and the ever tech-savvy Josh King, the mighty VISTA leader of whom legends will be told, at least over the course of this next year.  The most significant resources that each of us has found and developed in the past month are partnerships with other organizations and media producers locally.  I have begun cultivating working relationships with <a href="http://www.anti-war.net/">AWARE (Anti-War Anti-Racism Effort)</a>, <a href="http://www.city.urbana.il.us/urbana/finance/is/uptv/Main.asp">Urbana Public-access Television (UPTV)</a>, the <a href="http://2008.pygmalionmusicfestival.com/">Pygmalion Music Festival</a>, The <a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/">Sunlight Foundation</a>, and <a href="http://www.pogostudio.net/aboutpogo.htm">Pogo Studio</a>, and there are many more I hope to contact over the next few months.</p>
<p>Of all my current or completed projects, the one that has been my primary concern is the restoration and updating of the UCIMC Production Room, which doubles as a multimedia production studio and as the VISTA office for Nicole and I.  There is of course space always reserved for Josh who comes and works with us several times a week, and who helped us all a great deal by updating our <a href="http://ubuntustudio.org/">Linux Ubuntu</a> workstations and by providing tech equipment and guidance.  Organizing members of the Tech and Shows groups, I have helped re-instate the UCIMC Media Production group to manage the studio and to offer educational and media editing services to the public.  I will be meeting late this week with a member of Tech, the WRFU <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/dan.blah/RandomUCIMC/photo#4964706813017784338">station</a> manager, and Nicole, who is helping us apply for a community grant that will allow us to update our public-access lab and develop a curriculum for open-source media workshops.  Already we have set up Linux, PC, and Mac workstations, with a wide variety of open-source, freeware, and commercial studio software programs.  I have started a log-in system for accessing the facilities and for donating equipment, and I am building a budget with which to make further improvements.</p>
<p>Other current projects include ongoing training sessions that I am offering to UCIMC volunteers on recording audio from multiple sources, testing and connecting A/V devices, and live sound reinforcement.  I have inadvertently become somewhat of a venue manager due to the small size of the volunteer Shows group, and even though I enjoy working with a <a href="http://shows.ucimc.org/facilities">sound system</a> that I helped set up (look for Chris Evans’ huge cardboard sculptures), this has become a source of direct service that I will have to spend less time doing.  My next major workshop will be the re-training of the entire WRFU staff on studio and on-location broadcasting, which will begin late this week and continue through September.  Currently I am also editing an AWARE video project and scheduling a webinar on independent and local congressional investigation between Bill Allison of the Sunlight Foundation, WRFU, Public i, and IMC-Web.</p>
<p>My expectations and challenges for the next month will be drafting the first series of media training manuals, developing workshop curriculum on open-source media production, recording PSAs and shows for WRFU, and video projects with the Public i, Shows group, and the Urbana-Champaign <a href="http://www.thebikeproject.org/">Bike Project</a>.  I also expect that my future field reports will be shorter.  I have much to do and more to learn, and there will need to be as much community networking as technical work in order to achieve my project goals.  I look forward to reading everyone else’s reports, and I am ready to be educated and humbled by my fellow VISTAs, who are all doing interesting and impressive work.</p>

				<p>Moving to rural Kentucky sure was an experience. But as the days pass I'm settling in more and getting more accustomed to living in such a small town.  I'm really enjoying my work at Appalshop.  I'm working specifically on the <a href="http://www.thousandkites.org" title="Thousand Kites Project">Thousand Kites Project</a>, which is a relatively new initiative within Appalshop to promote dialogue around the criminal justice system.  We do that through various forms of media: film, theatre, radio, and the internet. One of my big projects is to help develop the the web-based portion of the program.  I'm working on creating a United States map through google maps that people can navigate to post their own stories, hear stories, see films clips, photos, etc. Through this site we'll be able to connect people on a national (for now) level to engage in conversation.  We're also looking at other social networking sites such as Flikr and Facebook to be tools for access.  </p>
<p>I'm also learning our content management system, which is exciting. I feel like I've become much more technologically savy working here!  </p>
<p>I just got back from a fantastic five days at the Annual Meeting for <a href="http://www.alternateroots.org" title="ROOTS">Alternate ROOTS</a>.  ROOTS is a gathering of social justice artists from the south. It was incredible few days and I did a lot of great networking with people in this region.  Technology is on the table and many in leadership there are looking to the younger people in ROOTS to guide the way in becoming a technologically efficient organization.  We at Appalshop will be part of that process.</p>
<p>Now I'm looking forward to using what I've learned so far and really moving forward in a full and ready way.</p>

	    <p>Great post, Julia!  I am glad you are getting settled in your new community.</p>
<p>The thousand kites site and the social networking sites it is connected to reminded me of a blog post i was reading about establishing an organization's brand across social media.  I don't know how much of this has already been mapped out, but it still might be a good read: <a href="http://www.chrisbrogan.com/50-steps-to-establishing-a-consistent-social-media-practice/">50 steps to establishing a consistent social media practice.</a></p>

				<p>The first month went by like a blur. It was so fast I almost forgot to post a report (oops!). It's probably a cliché, but I really did hit the ground running. </p>
<p>My first week was busy with trying to make heads and tales of exactly what I would be doing for my year. I sat down with Josh (my supervisor) and we mapped out a plan for the year. Something that was real helpful was a skill assessment that we wrote out together. We listed skills that I have or would like to have by the end of the year and then he asked me to place my self on a scale from 1 to 10 on each skill. We promised to check in every three months to see how I was progressing. It was also good because it gave us guidelines for the kind of work I would be doing. Once that was finished, he had me working right away. </p>
<p>The highlight of last month was a report that Josh and I co-authored on the way the City of New York shares its information electronically. As a media justice organization, PPH focuses on media and internet policy. One of the ways that we advocate for a more free and more open internet is through periodical articles on key issues that go hand in hand with our organizations overall agenda. </p>
<p>This particular article focused on the way NYC could take better advantage of technology for more government transparency and more government participation. It was exciting because researching for the piece had me talking to people across the spectrum. I spoke to representatives at City offices like the NYPD and the Dept. of Information Tech. and Telecommunications who thought the city was doing a brilliant job on sharing information. I also spoke with people like Daniel O'Neil at everyblock.com (a website dedicated to offering citywide statistics for several cities across the US) who though the NYC could do much better. I also spoke with Council Member Gale Brewer who has been one of the big players within the City government pushing to use technology more to make government more accessible. In the end, I learned a great deal about what they do here at PPH and understood how better to help the organization in building towards doing more advocacy work like this. If you want to check the article, you can go <a href="http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/tech/20080805/19/2602">here</a>.   </p>
<p>Overall it's been an exciting month and I'm looking forward to what lies ahead. I'm currently trying to rework the programs community outreach strategy, which is proving to be a challenge. I'm also trying to narrow down a few course options for the In Service Training. Till next month.</p>

				<p>Just like that, three weeks have passed already! I have already written some content for our site since Grassroots.org just launched their Toolbox, which has a bunch of web development and business services all in one convenient spot. Some of the services that we provide are domain registration, web hosting, web building tools, virtual phone office, and even project consulting. I'm sure that some of the organizations that you are all working with may need one or more of these <a href="http://grassroots.org/services" title="Tools"></a> so feel free to check it out and possibly sign up. </p>
<p>My job this month has been making sure the help content and layout of the Toolbox is easy to navigate and understand. I am getting a lot of feedback from the members who call in asking for help, which actually makes my job easier. The hard part is thinking about how to easily present information so that our members, most of whom aren't tech savvy, are given information in an intuitive format. Having experience in creating web content, I think I'll have to learn a little more about information architecture and HTML before I can complete the project. </p>
<p>Besides that, I have been writing writing writing! It's my niche of course, and right now I'm writing a short piece to be published in the WSJ (WEB Street Journal, ha!)</p>
<p>I've also been encouraged to think about some future long-term projects at Grassroots, which is maybe what I'll be updating on next time I post! I hope everyone else is enjoying their month and adjusting well!</p>

				<p>This first month at UTEC has definitely been activity filled! We have a bunch of programs and activities planned... a youth show, promo spots, commercials, a documentary.. etc (only etc because we seem to add to the list daily) All of the activity is great, lately I've been filming UTEC events and editing them along with LTC's VISTA .. Thomas K. Everything is going well so far and as I organize the various projects I know that things will only get better... Alot of fun, alot of filming and alot of editing... that's what I signed up for and I hope things continue to go in that direction as far as my work. I know that my supervisors want me to become more of a factor in the outreach and street work process here at the Teen Center, but I signed up to mainly use my media skills as a tool to do so.. I hope I can show them, that I will truly be more useful as a silent behind the scenes type director of the media movement as opposed to a direct link between media and Lowell's youth... but as my comfort level with Teens in general increases I wouldn't be surprised if sometime in the future, I find myself working directly with Teens and enjoying it. Only time and progress will tell...</p>

				<p>A lot of what I do is research, which means reading many techie and media blogs, going on YouTube, Daily Motion, Blip.tv, and following any other leads I happen to catch. Half the time I’m not sure whether what I’m doing counts as work, since how many people can claim that going on Facebook or using Ning is part of their job function? Not surprisingly, I sometimes find myself in incredibly mind-numbing lulls because there’s only so much staring and reading you can do before your brain fries.<br />
I’ve also started keeping a blog on Portland Community Media’s website that I update every Friday. The blog feature on the site is not often used and is extremely contained (no way to post to other sites like Digg or Facebook, can’t email and no RSS feeds). Only staff members use it. Because of this, I’m currently helping them revitalize their blog feature and their web presence.<br />
I’m part of the Access 2.0 committee and the Media Education team. Access 2.0 is a three-year grant that allows PCM to update all its gear to support future New Media stuff and to transition from video to digital records. We're halfway through Year Two right now. Under Access 2.0, I’m scheduled to team-teach twice for the coming quarter on “social networking” (oooh... shiny).<br />
This last weekend I went to Pickathon, an indie bluegrass music festival at Pendarvis Farm outside of Portland (next PCM blog entry). PCM was filming there, and I got my first taste of directing and filming. It’s incredible how much video has in common with photography, except that everything’s moving. And all the considerations you have to make because of movement and how that dictates the order of frames. It was especially fun working the camera, and I even learned how to work a jib cam.<br />
So coming up I’m supposed to do interviews with the various teams at PCM about how they use Facil. We’re transitioning to a Drupal database and PCM wants to figure out the pros and cons to fashion their new database.<br />
I also have some ideas in the works for new media (and New Media) programs at PCM that are more accessible to a greater demographic—in particular for low-income. PCM has not been the best at outreach; people come to them. I’m not sure whether PCM even has the staff capacity for outreach. It has waived class fees before for students who can’t afford them, but I still think there’s a lot of barriers despite this. Serial classes, tech savvy-ness, volunteering for production—all of this stuff is not necessarily doable if you really have to scrape for a living. Multiple jobs, being on call, even the amount of cultural exposure to technology are not necessarily conducive to video tech for expression. More to come, but right now I’m thinking cell phones and mobile tech.</p>
<p>Oh, and read my blog. :)<br />

				<p>Hello VISTAS!<br />
I hope everyone is officially settled in their new locations and that the first few weeks on the job have been progressing smoothly. Things in NYC have gotten off to a "Great start", as the title of this field report confirms. Along with Alice, I have been learning the ropes at Grassroots.org and getting a better idea of what the year will bring.<br />
One of the things I've been working on with our website (which provides other nonprofits with free technology/online services) is helping to coordinate our Volunteer Web design program.<br />
When a non-profit signs-up to be a Grassroots.org member, they have the opportunity to apply for a volunteer web designer to help them create or improve their site! The volunteers come from all over the world and it's great to see how many talented people dedicate themselves to our member nonprofits. Some of my tasks include connecting/outreach to new volunteers (Craigslist, Volunteermatch, idealist.org) and finding a more effective way for our organization to measure the impact of the volunteer program(tracking the hours volunteers spend on each site).<br />
You can see the Grassroots.org volunteer site <a href="http://volunteer.grassroots.org" title="here">here</a> . If the program sounds cool to you and you have web design experience check out the "Opportunities" section to see if there's an organization that interests you!!</p>
<p>Hope to hear about everyone's work soon :)<br />

				<p>Last week, three young men came into my organization. Initially, I didn’t have a clue why they were here but was told they would be dismantling the moveable wall out of the middle of my room in order to stop the “cubicle” feel of my office. The three of them are recent graduates who grew up in NJ. As it turns out, they’re doing a documentary on volunteering while taking a road trip across the country. When they visited us, they had just started their journey. </p>
<p>     If anyone’s interested, their videos from July 25 are from my organization. Their website is <a href="http://goodworkstour.wordpress.com/" title="http://goodworkstour.wordpress.com/">http://goodworkstour.wordpress.com/</a>. If you want them to visit your organization, shoot them an email or shoot me one and I can let them know. They’re nice guys and their schedule seemed pretty open. They have been doing volunteer work in each organization they’ve visited. I really admire their work and I have to admit, part of me wanted to join them on their tour of the country.</p>

				<p>Your friendly neighborhood (for Boston and Lowell) VISTA Leader here, detailing how I have not died once again.  Take that Grim Reaper!</p>
<p>Of course, it was great meeting all the VISTAs for this year, and I look forward to working with and learning from you.</p>
<p>This last month was consumed with PSO, so developing the materials in the binder and the On-Going Professional Development materials was my big concern.  Any resources I have generated has gone into the PSO binder or OGPD.</p>
<p>Right now, I am working on the On-Going Professional Development (OGPD) materials and researching CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software for both managing finances and project/program management.</p>
<p>Projects on the horizon are helping develop the marketing and communications plan for CTC VISTA, particularly around upcoming conferences, where I will hopefully see more of the VISTAs and OGPD roll-out.</p>
<p>Challenges: Boston is still trying to kill me, as usual.  Figuring out how to get across all of the ideas/actions for the Marketing section of the OGPD.  Evaluating the CRM software when I won't be the main user.</p>
<p>I think that is it for me.  Again, good luck with your work, don't hesitate to contact with questions, and have fun storming the castle.</p>

				<p>So, first of all, it was great hanging out with everyone at the PSO in Boston this year. We have a really great crew this year, which makes it a fun and challenging time to become a VISTA Leader, and I'm really looking forward to the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Since the PSO, I've been mainly going over the PSO feedback, getting caught up on my projects at Acorn Active Media, and helping to get Stephen and Nicole settled in their roles as VISTAs at the Urbana-Champaign Independent Media Center, which is about 4 blocks from my apartment. Acorn is closely allied with the IMC, and I've always spent a great deal of time there helping out. It's really great to see the IMC having regular staff meetings, and mobilizing around getting them active on their projects.</p>
<p>I have to go up to Chicago this weekend, so right now I'm just trying to make sure that the two of them have everything they need, and to complete some of my projects before I have to leave. Currently I'm working on creating new drafts of the research whitepaper on open-source wireless mesh networking that I completed in May, and of the ARIN IPv6 policy proposal for community networks. The former needs to incorporate some edits by another member of Acorn, and I'm using the opportunity to shore up some of the citations and to add screenshots from the newest build of the mesh software we're developing, but in order to do that I need to build custom images and determine how to flash them onto the hardware I have (Fonera+'s). The latter was introduced at the ARIN meeting in May, where it received a lot of interest but was sent back for revisions. There's a advisory council meeting on a Thursday in the middle of each month, so I was trying to get the edit in for this Thursday, but I'm not sure if I'll make it with all of my other projects. It has to be done by September at the latest.</p>
<p>I'm also working on a website design project for Tokyoprogressive.org and ongoing server maintenance on the Chambana.net colocation project. Chambana.net has a new mailserver that I want to get online, and set up filesharing, distributed logons and a local Ubuntu mirror for the production lab that my VISTAs are working in. Hopefully I'll be able to get at least some of these done before Friday, but if not I should get them done in short order next week.</p>

			 	<a href="node/1284.html" title="research on computer use and child outcomes" rel="bookmark"><h1>research on computer use and child outcomes</h1></a>
			 				 	
			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p>One topic that we've been discussing at length recently is the wisdom of efforts such as One Laptop Per Child, which aim to greatly expand home computer use among low-income children, especially in the third world. It has been taken as fact that computer access is beneficial to children, but is this really so? Are computers an important priority, or are they a distraction from more pressing needs? </p>
<p>A new study offers an interesting perspective on these questions. Economists Ofer Malamud and Cristian Pop-Eleches studied a Romanian program that offered 200 Euro vouchers to tens of thousands of families with children. The circumstances of the program offered the researchers a unique opportunity to compare demographically similar families where the only variable was whether or not the family had received a voucher. The results showed that the program was a tremendous success at improving access to computer technology, but having a home computer actually had a negative result on the child's academic situation - time spent doing homework declined, as did GPAs. Children with computers were 13% less likely to want to go to college and, surprisingly, were no more likely to want to pursue higher education in computer science.</p>
<p>There are a few important caveats. First, and perhaps most importantly, parental involvement greatly reduced the negative effects of winning a computer voucher. This was especially true of families with a stay-at-home mother. Secondly, although the Romanian Ministry of Education provided free educational software, only 30% of families reported having such software installed on their computer. Only 20% of children reported using educational software more than once a week, versus 70% for games. Any new large-scale efforts to provide computers to low-income families need to focus on educational uses - something OLPC is doing, to their credit - to avoid the negative outcomes reported in this study. </p>
<p>Third, it is clear from this study that demand for home computers was very high with this low-income Romanian population. Over 90% of families used their vouchers towards a computer purchase - even though the voucher only covered about 75% of the cost of a computer. By my calculation that would mean that families spent about $80. If we consider that families needed to make less than $16 a month per household member to receive a voucher, than families were likely spending more than a month's income on their computer. If the demand for computers among low-income families in the United States even approximates that in Romania, than digital inclusion efforts shouldn't be afraid to charge modest sums for computers.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that only 6% of those surveyed here had Internet access at home. Fortunately, Internet access is more widely available in American cities than it is in rural Romania, but if a computer with no Internet access serves primarily as a distraction for schoolchildren, will the potential benefits of Internet access also be outweighed by the potential to distract?</p>
<p>Of course, this study only measures the impact of technology access in one area - school performance. It may be the case that computer access is a net benefit for adults - offering access to new resources like distance learning, for example, at the expense of time that would otherwise be spent watching television. Additionally, having a home computer in the United States, where computer knowledge is expected and the Internet is a major part of culture, may be relatively more beneficial than owning a computer in a third world country. </p>
<p>Having said all that, this study should give technologists the opportunity to examine carefully whether we really know as much as we think we do about problems like third-world poverty and education. We ought to consider whether computer technology and the ideas computer scientists embrace (open source or constructivist educational theory for example) may not be appropriate in all circumstances.</p>

				<p>Hello Fellow Vista's,<br />
This year of service is winding up to a close. And its been fun, very productive, and at time just plain hard work.<br />
We are well engaged in transforming our Jail to a Jewel. We have a full network infasture now that has both Administartive and open access conectivity across High speed Fiber and virtual private networking between switch closets in multiple buildings.<br />
Recently hundreds of Wellpoint health executive volunteers turned out to blase hiking trails and exercise sites accross our 47 oak forested site and along the stream that winds through the center of the campus. The site is really becoming park like. This is going to be a very good place to retire, stay engaged, and grow old! We will find wonders and engagement for kids of all ages!<br />
I have had the honor to work with some wonderfull volunteers. One Jim W is a 90 year old retired EE and rocket scientist. What a role model! He is there every day and stays fit as a fiddle welding railings, building Picinic Tables and a host of other tasks. He recently flew to DC for a recognition dinner and photo op with the Congress and the Senate.
