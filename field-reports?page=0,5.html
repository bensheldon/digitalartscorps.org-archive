				<p>Work at Aspiration has been going really well.  A few things are more or less falling into place for us and we've been excited to get going with a couple of projects that we've been working on.  I've continued to work on developing the ANSWR site in Joomla and I'm pretty comfortable with the CMS in case anyone needs any help (I've probably run into the same problem as you have).  I've decided that I don't really like CMSes but that they're a necessary evil.  Regardless though, I've really taken to this whole "building a website" thing which has pretty much cemented me into Geekdom.  This, proven when the last time someone showed me a website I automatically asked "what's it built in?"  *sigh*</p>
<p>Aspiration is putting together an event that happens next week in Amsterdam (!!!) centered around Open Translation Tools.  Basically throwing a bunch of people around the world concerned with translation (spoken languages) in software for social change.  It sounds kind of nitchy but it's actually a pretty vibrant community with a lot of grassroots love.  Other than falling into a canal, Amsterdam will have us running an Aspiration-style event for about 75 people for whom English is not their native language which should be interesting.  Afterward we're going to run a book-sprint which is basicallly where you lock a bunch of experts on a specific topic (in this case translation) into a room for a few days and they churn out a book.  Sounds insane.  and yes.  yes it is.  So for the next two weeks I'll be out there doin my thang.  </p>
<p>Other than those little nuggets of goodness, I've been working a lot more with specific nonprofits training them to use tech.  Before my role was a lot more removed from the people side and now I've had a lot more hands-on experience and I'm really diggin it.  Especially because many times you're saving these organization sooo much time by teaching them how to do stuff more efficiently.  And half the time you're explaining how to do something really basic in Excel works.  Yeah CTC VISTA capacity building!  holla!  </p>
<p>I feel as though technology training should be mandatory for any high school degree.  It would be amazing if tech skills were the foundation for people's work.  Think of the time saved!  gah!</p>
<p>So that's what's up with me.  What's up with you?</p>

				<p>I'm still working on locating and updating resources in our online, resource database.  I'm also working on 3 grants with Ronda, my supervisor:</p>
<p>* Compassion Grant<br />
* Kennewick CDBG (Community development block grant)<br />
* Richland CDBG (Community development block grant)</p>
<p>For the Compassion Grant, we're proposing to work with 50 organizations (non-profit or faith-based) to help them reach out to their communities with asset building and online, self-help resources to help at risk people get out of poverty.</p>
<p>For the Kennewick CDBG Grant, we're proposing to supply 20 young mothers who recently, or will have, their first baby with computers and internet access and provide them with tools for baby development and care, online education about Microsoft products (Excel, Word, and PowerPoint), resume writing, and office etiquette -- all to help them become more self-sufficient.</p>
<p>For the Richland CDBG Grant, we're proposing a project similar to that for the Kennewick CDBG Grant   we're proposing to supply a number of at risk families with computers and internet access, online education about Microsoft products, online education about resume writing, online education about office etiquette, and online access to information about social services to help them help themselves out of poverty.  </p>
<p>In the coming month, I'll be ending my term of service as an Americorps CTC Vista.  I plan to continue volunteering for RECA Foundation and 4People.org, maintaining the online, resource database and assisting with grant writing.</p>

<p>I also need to organize my documents in a way that is somewhat logical.  I'm starting a digital library of curriculum materials on our server that our staff can access and add to.</p>
<p>One of my last projects is designing a plan for creating a network of volunteers and schools looking for volunteers to teach media projects.  The idea is that when people come to us wanting to volunteer we can match them up with a class.  Network will be managed on our of our Drupal sites.</p>

				<p>Appalshop is suddenly brimming with new energy! Lots of summer interns have arrived, and all this good weather certainly is keeping everyone in a good mood!</p>
<p>I'm feeling good about my decision to stay on longer. I feel like a lot of the projects I've been working on all year are just now coming to fruition, which is no time to leave!  And I just get busier by the day, so I might as well stick around and get some of these new ideas and concepts going!</p>
<p>I finished creating our work plan, which was very helpful in getting us to think about what skills and assets each of us have and how to best move forward. I'm excited to be doing more work coordinating our volunteers and helping grassroots groups develop campaigns around their own goals. I'm working with a woman in the Virgin Islands to help them develop a campaign to bring VI prisoners who are currently housed in Virginia back home to the VI and to stop interstate contracts that allow for prisoners to be shipped across the country. You can check out the <a href="http://viprisonproject.wordpress.com/">blog</a> that they've created to get some idea of the work they're doing. And the post at the top about being on the radio is how they've been teaming with us so far. We have this radio program that allows them a way to connect with their loved ones up here in Appalachia.</p>
<p>The migration to the CRM SalesForce database is moving slowly. Our old FileMakerPro database computer has crashed (major virus), so we're struggling to migrate all our contacts. and also trying to figure out the best way to customize the new database to fit our needs. We're still on the lookout for a consultant to aid us in this, so if you know anyone, please let me know!</p>
<p>The online social networking stuff continues to aid our work. I've been twittering and we've developed a pretty good following, though it would be great to have even more followers! Check us out at <a href="http://twitter.com/thousandkites">twitter.com/thousandkites</a>. And I finally made us a facebook page (moving from just having a group), which is exciting because it means that people can more easily read about what we're doing. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=2204317&amp;ref=profile#/pages/Thousand-Kites/87764305558?ref=ts">Become a fan!</a></p>
<p>Let's see. I'm also preparing for our intern to arrive next week. And then we're bringing on a new VISTA member, Andy, to start working with us in July. So a lot of my work in the next month is going to be around preparing work flow charts and organizing our lives here so that we can seemlessly move into having a third staff member.</p>
<p>On another note, if anyone is interested in going to a a great festival next weekend, come down to Appalshop! It's Appalshop's annual <a href="http://appalshop.org/seedtime/">Seedtime on the Cumberland</a>. Music, crafts, food, literary readings, dancing, watermelon seed spitting, jamming. It's gonna be a great time!</p>

				<p>Hello everyone sorry I am late posting, as you may know from earlier post I am involved with getting the Community for Creative Non-Violence’s Arts and Education building restored. Since the last post I have gotten a designer to help with the restoration. Through her contacts I have gotten a structural engineer to look at the building, surprisingly he said that the building is structurally sound; the roof beams are in excellent condition for the age of the building. This was good information seeing that we wish to install a green roof. I have gotten free estimates from building contractors and some have offered to do work at no cost to us, great! As stated in earlier post through lengthy weekly meetings the individual partners in this venture are forming a partnership. This kind of partnerships will help us secure fund through the President of the United States stimulus funding soon to be revealed. </p>
<p>On Earth Day the individuals from the DC project organization and I went through the building and removed hundreds of old monitors, printers, and system units. These units were carried to the Environment Protect Agencies collect drive for Earth Day, upon getting there it seemed that no one else was going to show up, so a few of their volunteers offer to come back to our site and load more unit on the truck. In closing, just the other day a music writer stopped by to offer his services to help teach music writing to the residents of the shelter. Well, these days I do not have much free time, so until next post good luck to all other Vista’s keep up the good work.</p>

				<p>It is done! We have sent our <a href="http://www.communitypartners.org/wireless-documents.html">Wired for Wireless</a> report to the printers. This long awaited report is a best practices document that provides case studies of municipal-led wireless networks (i.e. <a href="http://www.wirelessphiladelphia.net/">City of Philadelphia </a>&amp; <a href="http://www.sfgov.org/site/tech_connect_index.asp">City of San Francisco</a>). So, we have worked on a distribution strategy.  We are thinking of using Twitter, Facebook, and IssueLab.org.  You might have seen me at NTEN’s NTC distributing a one page teaser on the report.  If you would like a copy please let me know by shooting me an email.</p>
<p>Other than that, I have been working on managing the database.  I will be honest; this whole process of figuring out our distribution plan definitely placed great importance in updating our database.  It has helped me to see our key holes.</p>
<p>Another of my tasks is to document procedures and methods to help current staff as well as setting up workshops for them to learn about useful tools such as podcasting.  I am trying not to do so much so that the staff may not be overwhelmed.  Three basic tools that I would like for staff to learn and continue to apply are: 1. eBlasting procedures, 2. how to podcast, 3. how to screencast (if I decide not to continue my service).  Maybe how to map out their constituents through Google Earth.  It is not much or too complicated as say, teaching others how to maintain a Drupal website, but I think it will benefit the organization.  </p>
<p>By the way, it was great seeing all the VISTA peeps at NTEN. Thanks Morgan for taking us to that one neatloaf place. What’s the name of the restaurant? A lot of people are excited about going there.</p>

				<p>I recently finished the MicroMentor Volunteer Recruitment Project – including project charter and project wrap up docs (actually reported some results today too.). I’m also completing conversion university classes from Google with goal of taking the Google analytics test. Doing tons of SEO research with another goal, i.e. creating useful SEO guidelines for my organization that won’t be overwhelming. Speaking of goals, I’ve been setting them up in Google and monitoring results. MicroMentor just finished a big new site launch and they are taking over the updating and creation of new pages (in-house), so I am hoping to write a UI Style Guideline for them before I leave.  </p>
<p>I am planning to ramp up on some of the twitter tracking tools, since we are getting tweeted about now. Creating Facebook cause(s) is also on the agenda, as is attending an NTEN class tomorrow on Facebook for nonprofits <a href="http://nten.org/events/webinar/2009/05/13/using-facebook-pages-social-good?source=netforum" title="“Using Facebook for Social Good”.">“Using Facebook for Social Good”.</a> Any advice from successful Facebook veterans would be appreciated.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the NTEN Conference; and most especially meeting up with fellow CTC Vistas. It was great to see Matt, Dan, Ben, Morgan, Art, Nate, Davina and Edward! We had a good time at dinner and some tasty huge slabs of (vegan!) meatloaf (called neatloaf). The NTEN Conference social networking and SEO seminars/notes are going to be a helpful resource. Next project, which is in the planning stage, is to encourage diversity when attracting new entrepreneur and mentor participants. </p>

				<p>I've got just about a month and a half left before my VISTA service ends.  Some of my main projects between now and then will be preparing for the tranisition of my responsibilities and ongoing projects to whoever will be assuming them, training new staff members and working on documentation.</p>
<p>Recently I've been working on a DVD for a documentary about a four year project my HOME Inc was involved in a few years ago with several schools. We're planning to make it available for sale, so the quality has to be top notch.</p>
<p>I also recently edited a video shot by students who attended the inauguration back in January.  Copies will be given to the students and donors that made the trip possible.</p>
<p>We're in the process of hiring new staff and restructuring the organization to work with new schools, with our program in the Somerville school district expanding. I've been interviewing many of the candidates for staff as well as assisting in the plannign for the summer and the following school year.</p>

				<p>April-May started with the <a href="http://www.imcfest.org/">IMC Fest</a>, three days of music featuring nearly 30 local performers and an art show in partnership with the Champaign-Urbana <a href="http://www.40north.org/events/festival.html">Boneyard Arts Festival</a>.  I was stage manager and worked with volunteer stage and sound techs, as well as artists, to keep us on schedule and make sure everything was working.  The event, which was great fun and raised money for our organization, was largely planned and organized by Dan Blah, our VISTA Supervisor at the IMC.  The weekend gave us a chance to promote the IMC, attract new members, and support the thriving artistic community here in C-U.</p>
<p>On the training side, I offered three sessions - one on <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>; one on radio automation (using <a href="http://zararadio.org">ZaraRadio</a>); and one on live sound.  For those curious about live sound, you will see by searching the Internet that most training guides or courses are not free.  Here are some links to free information to get you started: <a href="http://www.tiem.utk.edu/~gross/sounden2.txt">Basic Introduction</a> by Lou Gross; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_reinforcement_system">sound reinforcement system</a> article on Wikipedia; and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_sound_mixing">mixing article</a> from Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Nearly everything else this month has been about preparing for the summer.  For the IMC as a whole, this has meant the recruiting of over a dozen summer youth positions, funded through the <a href="http://www.illwa17.com/">Champaign Consortium</a> and organized by Nicole, while making internal space and institutional improvements for staff and guests.  For me, this has meant getting ready for my last two months as a CTC*VISTA and working towards leaving a useful legacy in media training documentation.  So far this year, I have offered dozens on hands-on workshops, helped to create and organize two large fundraisers, built partnerships with other local organizations, formalized working group procedures, and updated and suggested improvements to the IMC's production facilities, all of which have involved networking and collaborating and spending long hours at the IMC working with others.  Throughout the course of these last ten months, I have kept detailed notes and drafted some training materials, but seldom have had the time to sit down and compile it all.  So, from now until mid-July I will be working more independently on creating and archiving training documents, and have already begun doing more research to this end.</p>
<p>During April and May I did most of the substantive budget and curriculum development for the first session of the Don Moyers Boys &amp; Girls Club's Teen Computer Lab program, which will begin in June.  This has included outlining computer workstation and media peripheral specifications (with guidance from VISTA Leader Josh King), compiling training materials and exercises, organizing meetings of team partners, and researching new and innovative technologies, especially Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) for use in the lab.</p>
<p>Here are just a few links that I have found to be very helpful in my research and documentation:<br />
- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open_source_software_packages">List of open source software packages</a><br />
- <a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/">FLOSS Manuals</a><br />
- <a href="http://osswin.sourceforge.net/">The OSSWin Project: Open Source for Windows</a></p>
<p>There is much more available, but those are decent places to start.</p>

				<p>Through March-April, a very intense month, I guided several initiatives to create new training programs for youth and adults, to build volunteer activities at the IMC, and to make general improvements to our facilities.  The most involved of these is the Champaign, IL <a href="http://www.dmbgc-cu.org/">Don Moyers Boys &amp; Girls Club</a> (DMBGC) Teen Computer Lab project, a partnership between the Boys &amp; Girls Club, the <a href="http://www.ucimc.org/">Independent Media Center</a>, the <a href="http://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois</a>, and the local, private computer consulting firm <a href="http://www.supportechcomputers.com/">SupporTech</a>.  During the first month of planning, the partnering organizations agreed to a vision and mission for the new computer lab and training program to be offered by the DMBGC, which will be an ongoing program available to youth ages 6-18, throughout the year.  The IMC has led the development of surveys, curriculum, and budget, informing the design and staffing being organized by the other partners.  Our Program Development Intern Jason Keist wrote the surveys to assess the children's experience and interests, and I have been composing the lab budget and compiling a variety of technology and media tutorials and activities, all of which will also be stored with the IMC as documentation.</p>
<p>Along with IMC member Danielle Chynoweth, I presented a workshop on producing radio news for <a href="http://www.fsrn.org/">Free Speech Radio News</a> (FSRN), a grassroots independent half-hour newscast available online and syndicated to over 100 stations worldwide.  Please see the attachment for the training guide I wrote (geared towards Audacity, though any audio editor is appropriate).  Anyone can pitch a story, headline, or feature to FSRN, and once you produce the content, FSRN pays you and includes your piece in one of its daily newscasts.  I strongly recommend that other VISTAs encourage members, customers, and trainers in your organization(s) to learn and participate in FSRN as a resource for citizen journalism, media reform, smearing the digital divide, and earning income for a job well done.</p>
<p>I also participated in a roundtable discussion on social media presented at the University of Illinois by Chicago's <a href="http://www.newstips.org/">Community Media Workshop</a> (CMW), a group devoted to training news producers and journalists, and strengthening ties between media and populations in Chicago and the midwest.  I recommend CMW as a useful resource to anyone working in these geographic areas.  They inspired me to create a <a href="http://twitter.com/UCIMC">Twitter account for the IMC</a> - simple, but necessary.</p>
<p>Spring was productive in even more ways at the IMC, and I organized three volunteer workdays - one for the Shows/Booking group to troubleshoot, repair, and re-organize the PA, mixer, stage, and cables; one for WRFU 104.5FM to produce new station IDs and clean and paint the studio; and another for just plain spring cleaning of the building.  Along with volunteers in the Librarians and Tech working groups, Nicole and members of the Community Connections group, I setup a staffing desk with a computer workstation, IMC merchandise tables, and staff storage space in the entry to the main space of our building.</p>
<p>For the Production group, I offered three more workshops on video editing, wrote Terms of Use and Borrowing for our production room and public equipment, and upgraded one of our video workstations with funds we raised during the Film Festival.  Finally, following Nicole's hard work to obtain summer youth (ages 14-24) positions at the IMC through the Champaign Consortium, I defined one of the positions, a WRFU Audio Trainer and Archivist, who will join us soon to produce regular on-air content, update our public affairs automation, train members on live and studio broadcast, and archive our existing audio materials.</p>
<p>And then there was all the planning for another major fundraiser, the <a href="http://www.imcfest.org/">IMC Fest</a>... (see next month)</p>

				<p>Feb-Mar was a time of organizational self-assessment.  I was part of, or led, several discussions about needs for the IMC, including grants, involvement with social justice issues locally, more public-access computers, reliable building maintenance, and perhaps, most importantly, the consistent presence of volunteers to be available to staff the main space meeting areas to answer visitors' questions.  This was the month when early winter conversations started to yield actual volunteer mobilization, in the form of a Community Connections group, to assess the relevance and accessibility of the organization to visitors and members, staffing of the building for increased hours, a functional library with more public computers (running <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>), and 1-day projects to inspire people to work together.</p>
<p>I planned and facilitated a volunteer workday with the University of Illinois Alternative Spring Break club, who came to the IMC to help a) catalog our library collection; b) catalog and organize our radio station's music collection; and c) move boxes of books for our twice-a-year Books to Prisoners book sale.  Trainings on video and audio editing continued, culminating in another set of productions for UPTV.  Even though the IMC hosts many concerts, a real highlight this month was <a href="http://www.royzimmerman.com/">Roy Zimmerman</a>, a clever and entertaining singer-satirist who was kind and fun to work with.</p>
<p>In all, this was a month of vision, mobilizing others, and meetings.  The IMC is filled with people who have more ideas than they seem to be able to implement, and as a VISTA I am often the person they share every new inspiration and request with.  It is, in turns, distracting or informative.</p>
<p>Due to our members being so over-extended and busy, and due to the DIY ethic of the IMC itself, I have relied upon a very simple format for teaching video editing, which I would like to share.  This is crucial if you have people asking you for training who are also expecting to immediately begin working on their pet project.  I often receive these types of requests from activists and academics who have already filmed a bunch of events, or long lectures, and want to turn it into an informative video after the fact.  I just tell them that there are essentially only five elements to editing a digital video (outside of planning a video, which is different):</p>
<p>1) Cuts: Cut the scenes that you need to include to tell your story; nothing more, nothing less.<br />
2) Arrange: Re-order the scenes creatively to maximize your message, or merely arrange them chronologically for a simple educational video.<br />
3) Transitions: Decide the types and lengths of transitions between scenes (i.e. crossfades, dissolve, etc.)<br />
4) Captions or Titles: Add text and/or still images for clarity and information, or to break up scenes.<br />
5) Audio: Normalize, remove or gate unwanted noise, clean up hum/buzz; then add any necessary music, overdubs, or voice-overs - making sure to keep levels balanced.  Also, make sure audio is in sync with video!</p>
<p>This is a really simple approach that is ideal for quick learning and for basic, educational videos that are not aiming to be grand cinema - perfect for citizen journalism, YouTube, event documentation, and anything that prizes speed and accessibility over perfectionism and budget.</p>

				<p>Jan-Feb began a two month period in which both Nicole and I barely took a day off - no exaggeration.</p>
<p>The possible exception was a trip that a few of us made to Washington, D.C. for the Presidential Inauguration.  We planned this trip on short notice, to correspond to a community organizing event taking place at the IMC on the night of the inauguration - the idea being that we would film a documentary, or more appropriately a <a href="http://www.ucimc.org/content/u-c-imc-inauguration-2009-dc-trip-day-3-video-mlk-day-inauguration-day-photos">video diary</a> of our experiences, post daily clips to our web site, and then have a Skype video conference with everyone "back home."  Going with both my VISTA Supervisor and VISTA Leader gave me an excellent opportunity to get to know them better and learn from their areas of expertise.  Many superlatives apply to being in the capitol for that ceremony, mostly having to do with the sheer numbers of people crowding the streets and the willingness of strangers to be interviewed in the cold by other strangers.</p>
<p>As soon as we returned, I went straight back to the planning for the <a href="http://www.imcfilmfest.org/">IMC Film Fest</a>.  There was still much to do, including designing and distributing fliers and posters, doing interviews with local press and arts/events magazines, recording and broadcasting radio advertisements, and working with filmmakers to determine the final schedule.  The Film Fest was a success, comprising three days of independent, and most local/regional films, covering all lengths and genres.  We raised money for the IMC Production group, the group I helped create that maintains the media production facilities and builds a team of trainers who can assist and teach others.  I learned quite a lot about event planning and management; the small group of us that put it all together have a vast train of e-mails and Google docs that we are archiving with the IMC to help others create similar events in the future.</p>
<p>The remainder of this period involved less training than usual, just a couple of sessions on audio and video recording, and I continued to update and troubleshoot the WRFU radio automation system while helping to facilitate meetings of those interested in learning this "back-stage" aspect of radio production.</p>

				<p>I feel pretty bad that keeping up with these field reports has been so difficult - and because I have the flu... but that gives me some time to catch up and explain what kinds of things I've been doing at the IMC, one month at a time:</p>
<p>The IMC is in a college town (Champaign-Urbana), and a lot of our volunteers are students, grad students, and professors.  Even though Dec-Jan was quiet, with many out of town, I had plenty to do.</p>
<p>The month started with an interview.  To clarify, I was the one being interviewed, by two DJs whom I had trained, and whose semester project - as interns at our community radio station - had just ended.  Maggie and Alex, AKA "The Amplified Librarians," asked me about all aspects of CTC VISTA, AmeriCorps service, and the Independent Media Center.  It provided a great opportunity to reflect on my work and to share my observations with our listeners.</p>
<p>With a target date of the first IMC Film Festival looming in the near future (early February), this month was largely devoted to the intricacies of event planning.  The Film Festival was something that fellow VISTA Nicole and I brainstormed earlier in the winter, and with help from our VISTA Supervisor, we solicited film submissions, arranged scheduling, format, promotion, sponsors, and a web site all in the course of a couple months.  This gave me the opportunity to utilize and better acquaint myself with Drupal, as we developed the IMC Production Group and IMC Film Festival web site.</p>
<p>Despite the cold, empty climate, there was considerably demand for training, and I ended up delivering nine sessions to individuals or small groups, on audio editing for radio (in Audacity and Reaper); live radio broadcast; digital photo editing; field audio recording; and mastering.  As much as I have wanted to stick to the goals of "training trainers," this is in part dependent on the attitudes and goals of those being trained.  In our organization, in which everyone is volunteering whatever free time he or she has, most people just want to quickly be empowered with the knowledge and tools to accomplish some aspect of media or technology.  They do not often have the time to train others after I have trained them.  I suspect that other VISTAs in training positions have observed this scenario in their workplaces.  It's not necessarily bad or good, but just the reality of working with busy and ambitious colleagues.</p>
<p>By the end of this period, we welcomed a new Program Development Intern to the IMC, and oriented him.  I also continued to coordinate volunteers who produced IMC Video News for Urbana Public Access Television, and updated radio training materials, including a draft plan to revive IMC Radio News, which had been a successful project several years before I began my service.</p>

				<p>I've been continuing to work on finding hidden social service resources within the state of Washington in order to post them on our website.  I spent a considerable amount of time checking our listings and finding new resources for Spokane county.  I must have found at least 200 more resources for Spokane county and updated another 100 with website links. </p>
<p>Ronda, my supervisor, was on vacation for a couple of weeks, so I attended a senior networking meeting in her place.  It's amazing how many services are available for senior citizens in our community.  We have a strong support network for seniors to retire, from in-home help to long term care, there must be at least 50 organizations providing some sort of residential care.  Some new folks providing services attended the meeting.  One I noted was an attorney providing estate planning services for seniors at half the normal hourly rate.  That's a bargain considering that the going rate for doing a living trust runs around $2000.</p>

				<p>Since I've decided to stay on another year, my work these days hasn't been about wrapping up. Instead, it's been about moving forward! </p>
<p>We spent a week at a beautiful retreat center in Virginia on a grant from EMC Arts/Dorris Duke to strategize the implementation of a new innovation in the project. We're going to be spending the next eight months developing and launching phase two of our website. It will be a highly interactive advocacy space on which people can 1. hear a story, 2. share a story, 3. take action.  We're going to use advocacy tools (looking at possibly using Salsa) and are now in the process of working with a great consultant to help us develop a plan for a designer. An example of how this will work:<br />
We got a call into our StoryLine from a woman whose husband used to be a marine, and since coming home has gotten locked up. (Listen to the call <a href="http://www.thousandkites.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=395&amp;Itemid=113">here</a>)  We want to design a campaign around the issue of veterans being incarcerated. But right now we don't really have the capacity for that to happen. So this new web platform will allow us to kickstart that campaign and get people to take action. </p>
<p>To make that all happen, I'm doing a few big things right now:</p>
<p>1) developing a work plan that will help our staff clarify job descriptions and our roles in the project, and give us guidance in the coming months. I'm using a google spreadsheet to do this, so that we can edit together. </p>
<p>2) Continuing migrating our former FileMakerPro database to our new SalesForce database. Does anyone know of a good consultant to bring in to help us think about SalesForce?  We need to customize it to best suit our needs, and know that we can't do that alone...</p>
<p>3) Working with our audio database to find good content to help kickstart the new web platform. Also working with the artists in our network to produce new artistic content for the new site.</p>
<p>We sent out a survey to a couple thousand of our closest friends (mostly grassroots criminal justice folks) about the kind of communications methods they're using to help inform our development of this platform. I was able to analyze the results of the survey to help us understand what kinds of tools people are using. </p>
<p>Twitter has been a hit. I'm glad we're using it. Not only has it brought people to our website (one of my main goals for it), but I'm starting to have conversations with folks on it about criminal justice and technology. I also think that it's an organizing tool. Espeically when we're looking at how to spread messages/stories through the web, it seems like it's a productive way to reach a certain constituency. </p>
<p>And we're in the process of hiring another VISTA, which is exciting.</p>

				<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>From March 31-April 4 I attended the NFCB (National Federation for Community Broadcasters) annual conference in Portland, OR. What struck me immediately when I arrived at the Hilton was:</p>
<p>1. I was one of the youngest, if not the youngest, person at this conference<br />
2. The radio station I represent was the most illegitimate, pirate, DIY station out of any other station being represented<br />
3. I thought I was nerdy but I barely was at all compared to these people</p>
<p>All the different sessions were separated into the following tracks: All, Producers, Development/Underwriting, Fundraising, Management, Youth, Community Engagement, Technology. Naturally, I chose sessions under the producers and development tracks for the most part because that is what I focus on developing in my work at ZUMIX Radio. I dabbled in a bit of everything to get a comprehensive learning experience at this conference. </p>
<p>The following are the sessions I attended: Interview Techniques, Strategic Planning, Marketing, Setting Up a Membership Program, Producers Shaping the Sound of Tomorrow, How Do I get more Latinos to Listen to My Station?</p>
<p>Generally, I found the conference to be an excellent learning experience. I was disappointed by a few of the sessions that I was counting on to be helpful, namely the marketing and getting more Latinos to listen sessions. I couldn't have expected every session to be amazing! I wished there was a session specifically geared towards getting underwriting going for a community station. Underwriting is something I have been working towards achieving for ZUMIX Radio since I began my year of service but sadly hasn't gotten much of anywhere. Bummer.</p>
<p>There was a field trip for conference attendees to KBOO which is a community radio station in Portland. I enjoyed this part of the conference immensely because KBOO is full of some of the most eccentric people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting, including this dude with this insanely tricked out bike:<br />

My jealousy festers over their insane music library, and its color-coded organization!!!</p>

<p>I was invited to participate in a late night show after schmoozing with some staff people there! Sadly, none of the contacts I made followed up with any of my e-mails, the same goes for the people I met at the actual conference. Shrug. People are busy I suppose. All in all it was a great experience and a pretty cool city. I think I brought back some useful knowledge to ZUMIX and I would recommend this conference to anyone working for a community radio station. I would like to attend next year!</p>

				<p>It was a terrifying sight: a vengeful teddy bear chasing high school students down the sidewalk in downtown Cincinnati. If you attended the 90th Annual Reds Opening Day parade this year, you might have caught a glimpse of the bizarre scene near the corner of Race Street and Central Parkway, against the backdrop of high school bands and parade floats. </p>
<p>Well, don't worry, it was only a movie. </p>
<p>A teddy bear attack at the Opening Day parade was just one of the concoctions of the Clark Montessori High School Film Intersession: two dozen students in two teams were put in charge of writing, directing, shooting, editing, and producing a film, all in just two weeks during the school's annual intersession. Each group drew a genre out of a hat, and then had two weeks to work together and complete their film, with the help of teachers and Media Bridges education staff. For one group, that meant staging a scene during the rainy, 35 degree parade. </p>
<p>The student camera crew joined several other camera crews outside of Media Bridges, which were covering the parade live for local cable. The parade begins at Findlay Market in Over the Rhine, and moves down Race Street toward the Ohio River and the baseball stadium, passing in front of our community media center on the way. Some of the youth filmmakers had the opportunity to work with the professional and volunteer field production crews that were broadcasting the parade live from Media Bridges. </p>
<p>You can find out what happened with the teddy bears on the youth channel this month in the two Clark Montessori Intersession Films: Teddy, a sci-fi trailer for a movie about terrorizing teddy bears, and Unspoken Love, a cyberspace romance that shows how appearances can be deceiving. </p>
<p>(The film intersession was a program I worked on this month and wrote about in this article for the Media Bridges monthly newsletter. It was a fun project that turned out really well. Updates on some of the other things going on with the youth channel are on the way!)</p>

				<p>Hello everyone, there are no real big changes from earlier post. I have still been working on getting the Arts &amp; Education build up and running again. The individuals involved have decided to form a partnership to push the project through. The members involved include Technologists inc, a private company that has contracts with the United States government’s Energy Department. The company provides a portfolio of engineering and management services to public and private sectors world-wide, through exceptional design, engineering, construction, and operations services that ensure powerful solutions for their clients. Another group the DC Project consists of members of the Obama campaign. Father Jean-Claude Atusameso a program coordinator from Earth Rights Institute who is very interested in obtaining grants for the implementation of our green program. Lou August of the Wilderness Technology Alliance, for who I am a CTC Vista volunteer representative, is also very much involved in procuring funds and jobs for the homeless community.<br />
Together we set a round table discussion, here at the Community for Creative Non-Violence (CCNV), where we invited individual from the District Government and also local companies involved in Green Technology. The DC Project members were very instrumental in getting a great turn out and support. The Technologists inc, has offered a contract through WildTech/CCNV to test a program called MOM, they are hoping that the homeless individuals at the shelter will get involved with the training. WildTech/CCNV performs the task of training other homeless individual in computer skills ranging from computer refurbishing, Microsoft office programs, ecommerce training, and a recycling program which is in plans for next year. Some of the material may have been repetitive but this is all I could think of at the moment.</p>

				<p>I started <a title="Dennetmint" href="http://www.dennetmint.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">my personal blog</a> over a month ago and today, it got the most hits in its short life. According to <a title="Wordpress" href="http://www.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>' stats, I got 250+ views today and still counting.</p>
<p>My first thought? "Oh, no."</p>
<p>Because of my post entitled <em><a title=" Some cibo" href="http://dennetmint.wordpress.com/2009/02/20/cibo/">Some cibo</a></em>, <a title="Google" href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a> has been directing ever-increasing traffic my way. Notice in the top right hand corner of the post that half-naked babe in tube socks? She is the main draw to my page from <a title="Google Images" href="http://images.google.com/images?q=american%20apparel&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi" target="_blank">Google Images: American Apparel</a>. I've thought about changing the picture and hopefully the URL of the pic to something more obscure so it wouldn't pop up nearly as often. But after <a title="SXSW Interactive" href="http://www.sxsw.com/interactive/" target="_blank">SXSWi</a>, Wordpress has also been picking up search terms for "<a title="I Can Haz Cheezburger" href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/" target="_blank">LOLCats</a>." I'm pretty sure I used something obscure for the name and description of that photo in <a title=" Some SXSWi Leftovers" href="http://dennetmint.wordpress.com/2009/03/29/sxswi-leftovers/" target="_blank">one of my recent blog posts</a>, but maybe I was wrong.</p>
<p>It's all a bit discouraging in an <a title=" Alanis Morissette" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanis_Morissette" target="_blank">Alanis Morissette</a> kind of way. Take back my popularity, Google! Take it!</p>
