				<p>Right now, my major projects include...<br />
1. Obtaining a contractor to build out several wifi networks in Koreatown.  Attached is the request for proposals (RFP) I put together.  We anticipate having 4-5 bidders, and we're doing a site walkthrough with the contractors on Wednesday.  The bids are due on...the 11th I think?  Then we get to read through and select the one that best meets our needs...exciting.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Building a small wifi network at one of our apartments.  I think this will technically be our last in-house deployment.  Just waiting on budget approval.  I'll update with more about BPL as I deploy (and inevitably encounter problems!) but for now you can see the proposal.  BPL + open mesh will provide more than adequate coverage of this small building, I think it's a good way to deploy in buildings with simple layouts and small floor plans like the one we're doing.  The goal is to get it deployed before Thanksgiving.  Eek.  Physically deploying is the easy part, it's just getting the money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepping donated computers to be given to families, to be given out after we launch the new wifi network.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Since last time, I finished the main sections of the Wireless Wiki, an online manual and community space to help residents maintain/troubleshoot their free wifi networks on their own:<br />
<a href="http://wiki.littletokyounplugged.org/LTSCWireless/" title="http://wiki.littletokyounplugged.org/LTSCWireless/">http://wiki.littletokyounplugged.org/LTSCWireless/</a></p>
<p>Alsot held the first resident wifi meeting at one of the housing projects, Angelina Apartments.  The wifi there is Meraki (a more expensive type of wireless mesh) and was set up about a year ago.  The peeps who showed up seemed really interested in making the wifi better (it has been arguably spotty and not as good as it could be).  So, will be working to install more gateways and access points, try to get coverage to all parts of the building.</p>

				<p>Hola DASCorps!This is my update for the past month or so...</p>
<p>1. Formed an excellent partnership with the Southwest Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Festival. Encantada TV (the new public access channel)was THE TV media sponsor. With that partnership Encantada TV had an ad before every single feature film at the various venues, logo on their website and inside their program. What we did in return was, I filmed the Film Festival. Went to 3 different parties to shoot interviews and get b-roll footage for the "Here &amp; Queer:Voice from the Southwest Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Festival" movie. I also go to interview cult icon Mink Stole and Jane Wiedlin, from The Go's Go's, haha, that was fun. I also had to go and meet with location sites to get release forms signed. By going over to 100 Gold Loft to get Rick Rennie to sign off on the release form, we had positive communication about working together in the future with filming Flamenco Dancers (who ideally will do performances at the space 50 days/yr).</p>
<p>2. Worked on spreading the word about the 10/10 city council meeting. I sent out info to various media outlets, organizations and producers.</p>
<p>3. Mike, Amelia and i met to discuss details and preparation for upcoming fundraiser events. Same day met with Jamal Davis, Manager of Casa Vieja, to arrange their donations for the QUQ Fundraiser Gala at our station. Jamal said he will work with his fellow friends, who own various indep restaurants in ABQ to also sponsor food donations. Meeting with Jamal on 10/26 to follow up with progress. Looking to possibly tap into his resources with Marble Brewery and to host our "after party" at Marble Brewery</p>
<p>4. Contated UNM-Dept. of Communication &amp; Journalism (John Oetzel). Asked if C &amp; J Dept. would be interested in having some of their students host a weekly news program @ our station on E-TV</p>
<p>5. Contated UNM-Caroline Orcutt (Program Supervisor,Digital Arts / Macintosh Training, UNM Continuing Education) “This sounds like an excellent opportunity for our students. I can forward your information to our advanced and graduated students and our film instructors, and I can post it in our employment/events book. Would you like me to do that? We could also possibly make it a goal for one or more of our more advanced film classes.”  </p>
<p>6.Contacted UNM-Department of Cinematic Arts, Jenn Griggs,Administrative Assistant (P) 505-277-6262. “This sounds like a wonderful opportunity for our students. I can hang fliers (pdf / images / text is fine) and also announce with on our listserv (text only). I will also forward this on to the faculty so they may tell their students as well, and they may email you with questions.”</p>
<p>7. Contacted a few local organizations about doing cross-promotional trades. Some of these trades would be to work with local stores and organizations to give QUQ producers a discount at their store, in exchange for promotional space on our many services (Video Bulletin Board, newsletter, website, PSA).</p>
<p>8. Worked on a quick and dirty fundraiser event. @ events were organized-TGIFridays &amp; Fuddruckers. Contacted TGIFridays-Contacted GM and QUQ is hosting 3 different fundraiser events called “Benefit Night.” Everyone who goes to eat on the assigned dates and times, will have 20% of the proceeds go to QUQ for its moving expenses. Fudruckers-Contacted GM and QUQ is hosting 3 different fundraiser events called “Benefit Night.” Everyone who goes to eat on the assigned dates and times, will have 20% of the proceeds go to QUQ for its moving expenses.</p>
<p>9. Contacted  Public Academy for Performing Arts-Sue Hudson—Submit films from students of performances, dance all filmed at NHCC. PAPA received a NM Arts Grant and would like to use that grant for a series on Encantada TV. Sue is also a filmmaker and her film won at the NM State Fair and is interested in submitting it to E-TV.</p>
<p>10. Had a meeting with KUNM (local NPR affiliate)—Contacted Roberta Rael, Youth Radio &amp; Richard Towne (GM) regarding cross-promotional services.Youth radio: mission is to empower youth through radio—tackling various social issues. Ways we decided to collaborate were: (1) To build a training model of KUNM-document youth radio processes and create a training video. (2) Film Youth Radio @ KUNM-This will be a mutually beneficial partnership, as Encantada TV will receive local programming and Youth Radio will learn more skills (being on TV) and cross-promote KUNM. This will show how youth are developing skill sets, inspiring various community members to pursue video production and for QUQ producers/staff to learn /pursue radio production.</p>
<p>11. KUNM: Discussed with Richard Towne, GM, ways we can cross-promote our mediums. There are about 3 different local radio segments QUQ staff (Erica and Colleen?) will film to be later broadcasted on E-TV. There is a live call-in show, 8am every Thursday, a weekly Music Showcase, “Ear to the Ground,” highlights local NM musicians, playing songs and interviews. We will further discuss logistics with Tristan, Programming Coord., to spell out our production set-up and getting the approval from hosts and guests to film them.</p>
<p>12. Continued and finshed the "Here &amp; Queer" dvd! Will go on Encantada TV and our community media space, hosted by Miro Community!!!</p>
<p>13. Worked on marketing the "Benefit Night" fundraisers being help at T.G.I.Friday and Fuddruckers. Sent out mass email via facil promoting the events &amp; encouraging people to go out to these restaurants as up to 20% of the proceeds go to Quote Unquote for our moving expenses. Sent the info to the ABQ Journal, Alibi, KOB &amp; KOAT online community event section on their website, and circulated it around to other organizations (SVEDC, MACCS, etc) to spread the word.</p>

				<p>Hellooo DASCorps!</p>
<p>Work at NAMAC has been busy, albeit running smoothly.  I had the opportunity to take a Web Design Intensive at BAVC, and am currently relaunching our site's new look (it'll be finished on Sunday.. <a href="http://namac.org" title="http://namac.org">http://namac.org</a>).  The intent is to make it a bit more friendly for navigation and usage.  I also attended a free Bay Area Drupal Camp in Berkeley...  </p>
<p>Both offered me a better understanding of web development workflow, helpful tools of the trade, and language... so I feel more confident knowing what/who/how/when to ask questions, as well as how to best address issues on my own.  </p>
<p>Now that I've gotten the techie stuff out of the way... I'll be developing our site's blog so that its more interactive... well, hopefully making all of our online communications more interactive in general. Any tips people might have would be helpful :)</p>

				<p>Whoops, it's been a while since I've done one of these things. So my car was unable to pass smog and I'm currently trying to get the guy who sold it to me to give me my money back and he's dodging my calls. Thankfully my boss knows someone in Marin (where I got it) who used to do lemon law stuff and now does legal aid, so hopefully she can put the fear of God in him. But now I have a moped, which is exciting and insurance is only $9 a month, so you can't beat that.</p>
<p>Project-wise things are still in early stages yet. I'm looking at applications to hire a programmer for one of our sites (californiavoices.org if you know anyone who's good at Ruby on Rails and wants a low paying job you can send them my way). And moving the rest of them around so that they all are on joomla instead of a mix of random CMSes.</p>
<p>It seems like up until this point there hasn't been much standardization in the way they do web things. Everything is in different languages, hosted by different people in different places. So it's a little crazy making, but I'm slowly trying to pull everything together. </p>
<p>Thankfully I haven't had the food stamps issues a lot of people seem to be. Other than my mail seems to be super super slow so I got a letter the other day saying that because I hadn't turned something in they were going to cut me off, but when I called they said they'd gotten the paper work.</p>

				<p>So I can't believe I'm already a quarter of the way through my service as a VISTA. One thing that I'm realizing, which has been a nice surprise, is that serving as a VISTA has allowed me to grow both professionaly and personaly. The EDs and staff members at the two organizations I'm working with (CMAP and AMP) have been abolutely fantastic in providing direction and support for my project and have been really helpful as I've adjusted to a new environment.</p>
<p>When I began my service I was idealistic and ambitious and imagined that I would be revolutionizing Public Access within months of my project. Now I'm a bit more grounded, and have realized that everything comes in strides. Being out in the community more and making connections with other organizations in the area has really helped me focus my attention more on the needs of the community, and not so much on what's happening on the larger scale with Public Access, although that's still important.</p>
<p>On another note, life on the central coast in California is pretty sweet. I've moved to a town where chickens just roam the streets. Seriously...chickens!!!</p>

				<p>Friends of Trees, a nonprofit in Portland, Ore., plants trees. That's really the whole enchilada, as they say. </p>

<p>These are the stories I have been trying to capture on my organizational blog, Growth Rings, the past two months. </p>

			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p>In my last field report, I outlined four areas of archival work that I am coordinating at Center for Digital Storytelling. These areas concerned dark storage (for the long-term), RAID storage, physical storage, and networked storage. In the next week or so, we will be purchasing a RAID system that can hold up to 8 terabytes (TB) of data. This, my friends, is A LOT of data. What's even crazier though is that we have plenty more than just 8 TB that needs to be archived. 8 TB is only what we have precariously stored on our external hard drives, and doesn't include the 330 hours of Hi-8, VHS, DAT, and Mini DV, and 3+ TB that I just catalogued with some volunteers a month ago. </p>
<p>One of the questions this has raised for me concerns the value of narrative. Why do we create and preserve the digitized life-experiences of our storytellers?</p>
<p>My job is to find a home for all of our collected stories. I was hired to create a digital library–something not altogether different from a physical library that holds what appears to be an inconceivable amount of information. But the thing that makes the physical different from the digital in this case is that the digital has been quantified as we have attributed a storage amount to each storyteller's life.Is this the best way to capture the lives of our people? What is the value of storing the deepest secrets and concerns of our participants? Yes, we are an organization that uses these stories to show other storytellers the work we do. Yes, these stories help other storytellers better understand their own stories. And yes, preserving our digital stories helps us to stay afloat because it chronicles our progress as an organization.</p>
<p>But storytelling has an inherent context-based value. How one reacts and receives a story depends entirely on the place and space and time in which it is told. However, we pull these stories out of time, and out of context, and we store them. For what?<br />
For the future?<br />
For us?<br />
For the understanding that human experience needs to be chronicled?</p>
<p>But who gets to see them? I do, for one. And the occasional workshop will highlight a few pertinent stories too. </p>
<p>Stories are the only product Center for Digital Storytelling has.</p>
<p>Our archives hold lived-experience in suspension, and my job is to make sure that we never let go of the string that holds it all together.</p>

				<p>(I must apologize for the late field report. It hadn't occurred to me that October is halfway over!)</p>
<p>Well, September and this first half of October have been filled with minor victories and lots of frustration. Time has been flying, and I'd like it to slow down and let me catch up.</p>
<p>In addition to my main project, I've been doing some other minor work for my organization. After some tedious database updates, I was able to see the fruits of my labor with more clicks on a regional radio show my organization produces and distributes for free. It's a great show, and I was happy to see those numbers rise. I wrote my first-ever blog post (I know, I'm a bit behind on blogging), which wasn't much, but got some traffic. As far as my bigger project (a curriculum on using digital media as tools for social change), the victories are less tangible, especially since I'm the only author on this, but I've moved past initial research and outlining and actually started writing. </p>
<p>I'm also going to be working to make this curriculum more relevant to the Seattle CTC community by sending out a survey and doing on-site interviews. I felt that kind of relevance and feedback was seriously lacking from this project, and my supervisor took my suggestions seriously, so we'll have the survey out by the end of the week. While I had been talking to other Seattle media and nonprofit folks about what the curriculum could look like, and doing research into media literacy and digital inclusion programs nationwide, we hadn't been asking the people who we would be asking to pilot the curriculum!</p>
<p>It felt so good to put what I've accomplished into writing that I think I'll spare you the details of what hasn't worked. Now that I'm clearer on what my organization actually wants out of me, everything should work smoother.</p>

<p>I've been settling at my VISTA position at Thousand Kites.  I'm working on several projects.  </p>
<p>Current Projects:</p>
<p>- WEBSITE:<br />
I've been creating new graphics content for our website, including videos from Google Earth with flyovers of prisons, to make a database of prison images that we're calling the "Incarceration Nation Map".</p>
<p>I've been consulting with a web designer about our new website and video platform,, comparing different companies that use web video.  I designed and made a site map for our upcoming campaign site, <a href="http://www.prisonerrenting.com" title="www.prisonerrenting.com">www.prisonerrenting.com</a>.  I am adding content to our existing website.</p>
<p>- DATABASE:<br />
I've been working on the digital database of the organization, migrating contacts from the old database and customizing the databsse organization and layout.  I generated a sign-up form that links to our website.  The organization is prepping to send off an email blast using our new database.  The email blast will highlight our recent projects.</p>
<p>- MEDIA FOR CAMPAIGNS:<br />
I am adding more video content to our Youtube channel, customizing the Youtube channel page, and editing video for our prisoner renting campaign, and other video.</p>
<p>-SOCIAL MEDIA<br />
I am working to develop our organization's Facebook Fan Page and Twitter account.  I added photos from our Flickr account to our Facebook Fan Page.</p>
<p>Specific applications:</p>
<p>- Google Earth Pro: I am recording HD video of prison locations to use for web videos<br />
- Salesforce: Apps: Vertical Response for email and postcard generation<br />
- Final Cut Pro: for video editing<br />
- Photoshop for designing website mock-ups<br />
-Adobe Audition for audio recording</p>
<p>Challenges:<br />
Troubleshooting technical issues with our website content managemet system and digital databse.</p>
<p>Resources:<br />
Google Apps, Salesforce, Google Earth Pro</p>
<p>I look forward to:<br />
Working to connect with other video-makers to develop our website video content, and developing more graphics and video for our website.</p>

				<p>I just realized that October is almost half gone, which is just craziness! Well, what has happened since I last checked in? I'm still working on most of the same projects, like the Wiki and the "portal project," I think I brought that up last time. If anyone's in the South and knows of any museums or festivals that are related to food, please let me know and I'll make sure I include them!! I'm still helping schedule programs and they've been successful for the most part, I believe. The new website platform is not up yet, because the web-master really works on a volunteer schedule and hasn't had a chance to get everything together yet. I did send him a content layout plan though, so hopefully we'll be able to get that moving pretty shortly.<br />
We had a reception here for the National Food Writer's Conference, and many of the great chefs of New Orleans were here with some very delicious food. Emeril himself stopped by for a bit-- I like to think we exchanged smiles, but I'm not entirely sure! That was a really fun event that I enjoyed participating in. We're going to have another similar reception/ event next week, to kick-off the Big Read Nola project and to hold an opening reception for our first ever Food and Literature Symposium. It should be quite interesting!<br />
I have picked up a few new projects, including building an easy to read mailing list, which is currently a jumbled folder of lists and copies of checks and hand scribbled notes. I've also been helping to organize the Kid's Culinary Camps which happen a few weekends a month, getting the children's registration forms in order and keeping a file on them.  I've also taken it upon myself to spend a little bit of time everyday finding an interesting article to post on Facebook relating to food and our community. I'm learning quite a lot and people seem to get into reading them, judging by the comments and thumbs ups! I'm expanding our scope to look at other Southern papers, too! I realized that I have to keep track of all these things that I'm doing, to help me create the manual to leave behind.<br />
It's still a great time, and I'm enjoying the nature of my work here. I can't wait to start scheduling people for events to happen next year!</p>

<p>-PCF just launched a new project today - <a href="http://videowtf.com/" title="http://videowtf.com/">http://videowtf.com/</a> - it's a collaborative Q&amp;A site related to video production, so I'd love it if you all would stop by and ask/answer questions, and spread the word!</p>
<p>-Several Miro Community sites are now live! There are live sites at <a href="http://video.medfield.tv/" title="http://video.medfield.tv/">http://video.medfield.tv/</a> , <a href="http://mirocommunity.access-scat.org/" title="http://mirocommunity.access-scat.org/">http://mirocommunity.access-scat.org/</a>, and Erica's QUQ site will be at their domain soon, but for now is at <a href="http://quq.mirocommunity.org/" title="http://quq.mirocommunity.org/">http://quq.mirocommunity.org/</a>. I wrote a blog post about Miro Community for pegpoint @ <a href="http://pegpoint.org/2009/10/05/connecting-communities-through-online-video" title="http://pegpoint.org/2009/10/05/connecting-communities-through-online-video">http://pegpoint.org/2009/10/05/connecting-communities-through-online-video</a> . </p>
<p>I've talked to several of you about the Miro Community project, but I thought this would be a good time/place to say that if you think your organization would be interested in moderating/cultivating a local online video community, I'd love to talk to you. PCF has a grant from the Knight Foundation to create these local video sites, and I personally think they can be pretty hard-core and awesome, so I would encourage folks to think about creating one with us if you do local media work! </p>
<p>We have a few other sites that are in the process of being created. So far, the biggest challenge is convincing partners (other than Erica, who got it right away!) of the importance of doing outreach around the site and trying to really make sure we're on the same page about creating a local video community, not just a cool way to display the station videos (though it is that, too). I'm reading up on a variety of community media projects to help me express this better and figure out how we fit in. Besides the local sites, I'm still working on my feminist video site, now housed at nist.tv but not yet public. It's been interesting to me in doing planning for that the different visions people have for community media online. Is it more important to have a curated collection/ an editor's voice, or to have an archive? How do we encourage people to make media that others actually want to watch - what does that look like? These are some of the things I'm thinking a lot about as I continue with that project.</p>
<p>I have finished a draft "Partner Guide" to Miro Community which I will attach once I polish it off a little more, by next month. It's nice to have something tangible like this, though I have found that with this project, the chicken and egg problem comes up again and again. So I've written a guide, but I don't yet have too many real world examples, but it's hard to get real world partners when I don't have a guide/materials to show them... etc. I have grand visions for what is possible but sometimes it feels like people need to see those visions in order to get to them, which is frustrating at times. But we're forging ahead and it's working out!</p>
<p>-I'm headed to Public Media Camp in DC next week. I'm excited about the opportunities there, I'll let you know how it goes.</p>
<p>-I'm still getting used to blog post writing style, which I'm not always the most comfortable with. But I think this is one of those areas where you learn by doing, so I'm trying to just keep going for it.</p>
<p>-I have a ton of PDFs and books that I feel like I should read to help with my project and my overall knowledge, but I haven't been able to get around to doing it. I'm traveling this week, so I'm hoping that will afford some time to dig in to some interesting and relevant material.</p>
<p>-Thanks for all the advice on my previous post. Still adjusting to desk work, etc., and trying to learn to steadily plow through activities and keep track of them along the way. Something I find really interesting about the organizational culture here is that things are very flexible, so our focus can quickly shift. I like this, but it definitely takes some getting used to, so I'm trying to learn to be more flexible while also trying to stay on top of things.</p>
<p>-This month I'm looking forward to seeing the first few sites develop and thrive, as well as setting up new ones. We're releasing our .8 version of the software soon, and now that several sites are up and running I'm really excited to see what will happen with them and how we can build real local video communities. With that comes some anxiety about the collaborative process - except for the feminist video site, I'm not in control of content or really of outreach, so while I can help our partners with those areas, it's at times a challenge to be removed from direct development. But, again, a good one, and a great learning opportunity about capacity building in general.</p>

				<p>Since my last report,  a bunch of projects have progressed and a bunch more have begun.  The wiki has been moving along.  Almost all of the content is up, it's been reskinned, and I've added a translator and some access restriction extensions so we can store some somewhat "classified" information to it.  Mediawiki has been a breeze to use after overcoming some permissions issues during the install; for a website that is primarily for disseminating information, I like it a lot more than Joomla/Drupal/modular type things.  It isn't flashy and requires some setup, but it will be great to let residents create accounts and add info to the database.</p>
<p>Onto the new things.  Drew up a proposal for deployment of a very small wifi deployment at an affordable housing project, and will be deploying that before the years' end.  Wrote a request for proposals for wifi at a set of newly rehabbed housing developments for which we recently received a grant.  Found a really good resource for writing RFPs.  It'll be nice to both deploy a network firsthand and oversee deployment of a network by a contractor.</p>
<p>Am kind of excited about the wifi network I'll be installing.  It relies on Broadband over Powerlines (BPL), which sends wireless signals through existing powerlines and has been proposed as a way to bring internet connectivity to areas where it otherwise would be unfeasible or expensive to build out completely new infrastructure (rural areas, underdeveloped countries).  While BPL is yet to be totally proven/adopted for long-distance internet service (and interferes with HAM radios uh oh), it's widely available for household networks.  The plan is to just have one internet connection and then use BPL adapters to bounce the connection up to each floor of this apartment building, then build out an open mesh network around these BPL gateways.  The cost will be super low, less than a grand to bring free internet to the building, and the speed is gonna be acceptable, probably around 7Mbps down.  I'm concerned about hardware security, though.  There is lots of vandalism and theft in the building... still looking into addressing that.</p>
<p>Cheers, have a happy Autumn.</p>

				<p>Another month has gone by, fairly quickly I'd say. I have a feeling this whole experience is going to go by faster than I expect.</p>
<p>This month my major accomplishment was the completion of transitioning the CSL's Version Control Software (VCS) from Subversion to Bazaar. Looking over my last field report it appears, to my chagrin, that the last 1% of the transition took basically a month to complete. That's how it goes, right? To my credit, I've been doing a bunch of other tasks as well, and the vast majority of my remaining work with the Bazaar transition was documentation.</p>
<p>One of the other projects I assisted in was with another AmeriCorps VISTA, Carolyn, in preparing a demo of our software for the Ethos Roundtable, a monthly gathering of tech-focused non-profit leaders in Cambridge, MA. We put together a slideshow counting the top 10 flaws of our software, and encouraged the crowd to discuss them and how we could improve. Honestly, the crowd at the Ethos Roundtable need very little prodding to incite discussion, and we made it through maybe half the list in our allotted time. The conversations were lively and constructive, however, and the overall experience was a positive one.</p>
<p>This next month my primary focus will be in merging our two web applications (MVHub.com and NorthShorePort.org) onto the same code base and start work on getting the code ready to become a Debian package. We'll see how far along this goal I actually get.</p>

And yes- you're correct in assuming that the year will pass by quickly (at least that's what happened when I was a VISTA) but once you get to the end of that year and look back you'll realize you really did a TON of stuff.</p>

				<p>Greetings from El Paso, Texas! Another month at Latinitas and it feels like I have been here forever! I enjoy my job and the best part is to meet new faces who are interested in helping out Latinitas. I have been working on recruiting new volunteers interested in helping their community through Latinitas. It’s hard to find people who want to give up some time for a good cause. I have also been making new activities for our after school clubs. I have to come up with at least 4 a month for a total of 48 fresh new activities. The goal is for me to compile about 300 activities and make some new ones. It looks easy but it’s hard. I have also been working in a parent packet which includes a letter telling the parents who we are and what we do (a lot of parents don’t know where their daughters go afterschool, so we thought this would help us with donations) and also a registration form. Every form and application that I create I have to translate to Spanish, which isn’t easy, Spanish is my first language but having to translate and keep the same meaning it has in English, is hard. Also, I have been training new Club Leaders, so the training and keeping updates with them has been challenging, but fun.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have had a good turn out in searching for volunteers within local community colleges and university. They have sent their students to volunteer with us and we have connected them with the clubs as mentors. Some of the challenges though have been recruiting girls. We have a PR intern that works in promoting our clubs, she has done so much but attendance is still low. We have a low budget and can’t have ice cream socials to bring in girls this semester so I don’t know how to bring them in without incentives. I am worried about girl attendance in the clubs and not having enough girls and just having a lot of volunteers that don’t have girls to mentors. I am also worried about coming up with fresh new activities and not make them repetitive. I have asked volunteers to help me in sharing their creativity so I want to see how that goes. Also, I have heard some volunteers get discouraged by not seeing girls so sometimes I worry I am not doing a good job keeping volunteers interested. </p>
<p>On a personal note, there was hail in El Paso about 2 weeks ago, golf size. I also got a kidney infection around the same time. I am better now but now the hail totally dented my car and cracked my windshield. I didn’t know that hail would come to El Paso (it’s a desert where it never rains) so I don’t have full coverage. I am now driving s total loss Chrysler Sebring but who knows what waits for me next.</p>

				<p>So far I've created a 15 page draft of a business plan for the organization, made a presentation about the organization that might be turned into a video and I've been meeting with different people from other non profits for fundraising and outreach. We're trying to raise $5000 by January 1st so we can keep one of our volunteers in the country. She's an international student from India and her visa expires in January so she has to get a paying job by Jan or she'll have to go back to India. If we get the $5000 it'll cover paying her minimum wage at 20 hours/week for 6 months which will allow her to stay here.</p>
<p>It's slightly overwhelming to think about because whether or not I raise enough money it'll affect her future. </p>
<p>I'd like to think I'm persistent and determined enough to raise the money.<br />
Even if it comes down to crying at Phil Hall's door step at night. (kinda kidding)</p>
<p>The current project I'm working on is drafting a summary about MVHub software which the organization developed and currently maintains. Then I will possibly work with a volunteer through Jericho Road who can make it into a brochure. The brochure will be given to potential sponsors and community members. </p>
<p>Another project I'm working on is donor management and Quickbooks. Since the organization doesn't have an organized system of tracking who has donated or their information, I've been searching through folders to find information on donations from the past 4 years.</p>
<p>My next big project will be planning a fund-raising lunch for October/November. The event will hopefully accomplish raising half of our fund-raising goal.</p>
<p>I've worked on other random tasks in between my projects like create business cards for all the volunteers in the organization and confute a fine from the IRS.</p>
<p>Besides that everything else is going well! I really like Lowell and my roommates are awesome. They're really into music and playing instruments so we have 4 guitars, a keyboard, a violin and a bongo in our living room haha. It's cool!</p>

				<p>In my first month at Prometheus, I did a lot of reading. I familiarized myself with some of the issues under discussion at the FCC, such as rural commercial radio, digital radio, Tribal radio, and diversity reporting. Part of my job is translating these complex regulatory issues into terms that ordinary people can understand, so I first need to build my own expertise on radio regulation. It's an ongoing process.</p>
<p>Apart from reading, one of the best ways I've learned about the organization has been by volunteering to edit various documents that others are producing. By editing grant applications, newsletter articles, and press releases, I quickly learned about Prometheus’ current activities and priorities. I also joined a group tasked with rewriting our mission, vision, and values statements, which has helped me to understand the big-picture aims of the organization. </p>
<p>These tasks have been helpful in defining my own role at Prometheus, based on the needs of the organization and my own skill set. In the coming months, I plan to build a strategy to make Prometheus’ vast knowledge of media regulation more “user-friendly” and more widely distributed (mostly through blog entries and other articles). I also hope to reorganize our internal files on regulatory policy and to help with a more accessible regulatory policy section on the website.</p>

			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p>Life at Center for Digital Storytelling has become much busier since my last field report, and while I still love the Bay Area, I now have far less time to spend reveling in its warm glow.</p>
<p>I.<br />
As one of the Assistant Editors for our Executive Director's book on digital storytelling, I have spent countless days and nights editing the book's content and grammar. But luckily, I'm not the only one editing. Fellow VISTA, Oriana, is also working on the editing, and within the next few weeks it should be ready to go out to the publishers again for it's fourth or fifth edition. </p>
<p>II.<br />
CDS' archives have also occupied a lot of my time, but the results of this assignment are far less tangible. Over the past month I have been able to break down CDS' archiving needs into four categories that will all be implemented over the course of the year:</p>
<p>1)Archiving our digital media via "deep storage:"<br />
This includes transferring over six terabytes of data (digital stories) onto LTO tape, a long-term archival solution that helps to preserve digital media by placing it onto a hardcopy form that won't crash if there's a hard drive failure.</p>
<p>2)Archiving our digital media via a RAID system:<br />
 Basically, the RAID consists of multiple hard drives that copy all of our information across numerous other hard drives in order to a)store the data, and 2) prevent the data from being lost in the event of a system crash. This data would comprise all of the digital stories made in all of our workshops over the past 15 years. But overall, RAID's are annoying and very technical, and if you have any other questions please feel free to email me.</p>
<p>3)Archiving our digital media via a networked server:<br />
 This aspect of the project consists of uploading all of our data onto a server and making accessible to our instructors when they are out giving presentations and want to cue up an old story that has some relevancy to whatever it is that they're teaching. Furthermore, online access is the first step to making a YouTube-like interface where the public could watch and upload digital stories.</p>
<p>4)Archiving our digital media via our physical library:<br />
 Yes, in data management you need lots and lots of redundancy. "Redundancy" refers to making multiple copies of the same information so as to prevent data loss. Therefore, in having a physical back-up of each and every digital story at CDS, we can be sure that if EVERYTHING ELSE fails, then we will have CD's or DVD's of EVERYTHING. However, *ahem* earthquakes *ahem* "The Big One" *ahem*, could just do it all in.</p>
<p>But before any of this can be done, an organizational system must be implemented. It is of no use to have everything stored unless specific files ca be located. So that brings me to the next task: taxonomy! How does one categorize 6,000+ pieces of content? Good question! Tune-in next time.</p>
<p>III.<br />
And finally, my third Great Task at CDS is to be the Managing Editor for CDS' next book which will look at how people's stories help them establish a better sense of place, or identity. This prospect is VERY, VERY exciting. </p>
<p>Until next time,<br />
Patrick Castrenze</p>

				<p>Project:</p>
<p>Media Arts Center San Diego is opening a new facility (dba Digital Story Station) in North Park which will bring media arts to the neighborhood through a unique media gift store, a cool media lounge where media artists can hang-out, and media workshops for new media artists.</p>
<p>Happenings:</p>
<p>August was mainly devoted to researching and making a presentation to the Board of Directors regarding the legal structure for the new entity.  Upon arriving here on my first day, I had suggested that the new entity be a project of the current nonprofit corporation.  However, there was much discussion about creating a separate for-profit corporation or LLC.  I met with attorneys and business organization experts to acquire the necessary information to make a presentation on legal structures to the Board and a recommendation to the Board that the new entity should remain a project of the current nonprofit corporation.  The Board of Directors adopted my recommendation.  After the Board meeting, the Executive Director said that my presentation was brilliant.  My previous legal background helped make the presentation a success.</p>
<p>Challenges:</p>
<p>It was a challenge to conduct the extensive research necessary and to meet with a variety of experts to support my initial suggestion that the new entity remain  a project of the current nonprofit corporation.</p>
<p>Resources:</p>
<p>Document presented to the Board of Directors on August 13, 2009 is attached.</p>
<p>Concerns:</p>
<p>Funding sources for this project have not been secured or even identified.  In September, I now have to turn my attention to identifying viable funding sources and writing applications for those funds.  I am starting with the Foundation Directory Online (FDO) database.</p>

				<p>My first month has been really busy, with conference planning in full swing from the day that I started.  It was great getting thrown into the mix-- I got a crash course in event production-- from online outreach, building buzz via social media, etc etc.  </p>
<p>Now that the conference is over, I have time to start developing the projects that I have been thinking about.  I am hoping to revamp the website, and at the moment I'm working on a proposal for our staff retreat.  Attached is a web design draft I've been playing with in Photoshop.  If all goes well, this is what I'm hoping the front page will look like soon (minus some repeat icons and text of course)</p>
<p>Anyway, the office is pretty empty now that the conference is over.  NAMAC hires extra staff (4 people) for conference planning, and all are done except for the Producer, who will be staying on until the end of Sept.  Afterwards, its just me and 3 others.. so that will definitely be a change of pace.</p>
<p>I'm lovin San Francisco (the food! the weather!) and my co-workers are extremely chill and let me take charge of my own work, which has been great.  Overall I'm looking forward to diving in with my own projects :)</p>

				<p>Still loving the job. Zumix is closed this week to students (we're in between "semesters" right now, classes start up again on Sept. 14th) so it's eerily quiet in here. I can only hear one guitar right now as opposed to a rock band practicing, a drum lesson, radio show, and general chaos that comes along with working with high schoolers. </p>
<p>Anyway, it's going really well! It's a pretty exciting time for Zumix because we're getting ready to move over to the Firehouse, which is going to be our new operating space and is 3 times as big as what we have now. I've been inside a few times and construction is coming along pretty quickly. It's crazy to think about how much space we'll have to work with. We're hoping to move in November/December, and then hold classes starting in January. It looks like for now we're pretty much on schedule.</p>
<p>We're also getting ready for our Harvest Festival, which is this Sunday, Sept. 6. I've been helping out with a lot of the planning/coordinating and outreach. This has been everything from contacting bakeries to try to get them to enter our apple pie contest to actually walking around East Boston and hanging flyers for the Festival in store windows. It should be a good time. </p>
<p>Still working on a lot of the underwriting stuff as well. It's turning out to be quite a process. We went out to a couple businesses last week and are realizing what we need more of and what types of things aren't really necessary. (For example, getting stats for our website = SUPER important. Thank you, Google Analytics.) </p>
<p>We're also gearing up for next semester, interviewing kids and trying to work out placement and schedules. I'm excited for classes to start up again because I love the energy when all the kids are everywhere :)</p>
