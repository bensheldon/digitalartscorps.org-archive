				<p>Well, I&#39;ve finally moved into my own place.  After three weeks of bags and boxes, I was able (with much appreciated help from Danielle and Ben) to move my stuff into this great house in Arlington.  Great except that it was completely unfurnished and entirely empty, so my first night I made a bed of blankets on the hardwood floor; of course, I&#39;d had the foresight to buy an air mattress it was just the batteries I needed to inflate it that I&#39;d forgotten, so hardwood floor it was.  My roommates have since moved in, and I have a bed on the way, so things are now looking up.  
<div></div>
<div>On the subject of roommates, this has been my first experience living with people who I don&#39;t know going into the situation. It has proven to be a good one, and I&#39;m hopeful that it will continue to be so.  My roommates (2 guys, 1 girl) have been slowly moving in this past week, and it&#39;s been fun to see who brings what to the house.  I walked in one day after work to a unicycle leaning against the refrigerator, and after questioning my roommate about her unique contribution to the kitchen, was informed that she also breathes fire, walks a tight rope, and juggles (although not at the same time).   So, my roommates have interesting hobbies; they&#39;re also laid back, fun, clean, and pretty great so far. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>As far as work is concerned, I&#39;m getting into the swing of things, slowly but surely.  I&#39;m helping Danielle with the Digest (if  you&#39;re interested in writing an article, send me a note) and also developing a fundraising plan with Peter.  The rest of my time seems to be spent getting familiar with the non profit sector, ackronyms, and computer language.  All this is taking a little longer than I&#39;d like, but I have great people around me that are really helping with the process, and I&#39;m looking forward to adding more substantial value soon.  Anyway, hope everyone is doing well; I love reading about what you&#39;re all up too.  Have a great week!</div>

				<p>Week four at Project: Think Different is going pretty well so far. I adore everyone I work with and as you all probably already know, Colleen is a true doll! Always helpful, sweet and in a fab mood. Currently I am working on the Electronic Community. I installed Drupal and am skinning to mesh seamlessly with our existing site. During my first 4 weeks, I&#39;ve been having almost weekly trysts with SevenCorners (they are not insurance) and doctor&#39;s appointments. I&#39;m almost all taken care of now...The cool thing is that during one of my doctor&#39;s appointments the nurse actually knew what an AmeriCorps VISTA was--very exciting to not have to explain to a blank stare! </p>

				<p>After lackluster performances in July and August, the back-to-school rush has given WildTech new life--and a new volunteer with it.  Jesse Crowther, an Americorps recruit from the area, has been instrumental in this sudden resurgence.  He came to us through the Washington Service Corps with  high expectations  and an insatiable curiosity.  Since his entry earlier this month, the gears of a sophisticated machine are slowly falling into place.  Mr. Crowther has exhibited phenomenal organizational ability as well as unmatched capacity to adapt to  whatever challenges are thrown his way.  Case in point: Our main work area was absolutely unusable before he arrived; and we were not exactly a model for speed and efficiency.  Mr. Crowther saw this and took steps to fix it, installing a priority board and creating a workable system for maintaining the tools we use.  The long-overdue cleanup, combined  with some well-timed elbow grease, has netted WildTech two large sales totaling over $5000--and the final numbers are still unconfirmed. </p>
<p>We have also opened a new satellite lab in Bellevue, enabling us to reach those who lie deep below the polished surface of Seattle's Eastside.  Mr. Crowther's assistance plays big here as well.  According to his own testimony, he has drawn many young teenagers into computer repair, their eyes ablaze with wonder as he guides them around the inside of a machine.</p>
<p>Yet it is my role here that remains most vital.  I'm still *the* go-to guy for answers to hardware questions, and while I still do some grunt work around the shop, I am a trainer first and foremost.  New volunteers will always enter the fray, and it's my job to make sure things not only get done, but also that they are done right.</p>

				<p>After a spent the week trying to catch up with all the VISTAs under my care, encouraging them all to blog and read the blogs, I realized I haven&#39;t really blogged myself.  <em>What AM I working on?  </em>Well the first three weeks as an official VISTA leader has been a lot about finding a balance between two new roles. </p>
<p><strong>Role 1 : </strong>VISTA Leader at CTC VISTA Project at UMass Boston</p>
<p>This role was a little easier to figure out, since I&#39;ve got the Project pretty much figured out by now.  In fact, most of these first three weeks have been about helping the Project HQ staff get on the same page and think strategically about where the Project wants to go.  I hosted a little strategic planning retreat at my new apartment in Medford, where we compared assumptions, knowledge of the Project and whittled it all down into some concrete goals and actions for the Project.  Most of the fall will be consumed with populating the new <a href="resources.html" target="_blank">CTC VISTA resource portal</a> and putting the <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/digest/" target="_blank">Digest</a> together with <a href="http://digitalartscorps.org/blog/976" target="_blank">Erin</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Role 2:</strong> Program Coordinator at <a href="http://massimpact.org/" target="_blank">massIMPACT</a></p>
<p>[I just got that title today, mostly because we had to figure out something to put on my new business cards.]  Now, working with massIMPACT is all new.  massIMPACT is a non-profit housed at <a href="http://www.masshousing.com/portal/server.pt" target="_blank">MassHousing</a> that works to provide support to technology in housing developments accross MA.  So far, it&#39;s done work in digital storytelling train-the-trainer projects and partnered with Northeastern University among other things.  </p>
<p>The first three weeks were mostly shadowing my supervisor, <a href="http://massimpact.org/members/advisory_board/thaddeus_miles.shtml">Thaddeus Miles</a>, and being amazed at the amount of people he interacts with and is able to remember all their names and stories.  Meeting everyone and figuring out the housing development environment has been fascinating for me because I know a lot about non-profits in Boston but not much about this group.  The funniest part is how amazed folks are that I want to take the T to these meetings - I think it&#39;s a combo of fearing for the &quot;white girl&quot; in the Roxbury/Dorchester and not liking to walk on their part.</p>
<p>The other sub-role I have at massIMPACT is project managing the development of a collaboration portal for community digital storytelling facilitators at <a href="http://www.storiesforchang.net" target="_blank">StoriesforChange.net.</a>  I&#39;ve been reading as much as I can of emails from all the volunteers who want to build this site for sharing resources, curriculum, and lessons learned while providing place to publish stories as well.  I&#39;m excited because this site is truly a project fueled by the users (and not by a funder or higher power) and I get to work with new VISTA <a href="http://digitalartscorps.org/blog/968" target="_blank">Jessica McCoy</a> at the Center for Digital Storytelling.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://pazonada.blogspot.com/2006/09/mit-and-weird-day-at-cms.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/427/1151/0/unnamed-image-1-787553.jpg" border="3" alt="D on Audobon&#039;s moblog out with CMS Grad students" title="D on Audobon&#039;s moblog out with CMS Grad students" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="160" height="120" align="right" /></a>On a personal note</em>, I spent a good amount of free time these past couple weeks seriously thinking and researching my graduate school possibilities.  I highly enjoyed the session at the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/cms/">Comparative Media Studies Program at MIT</a>, especially because I connected with another prospective student (Ms. Audobon, who <a href="http://pazonada.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">moblogs</a> and with whom I had way too much in common with for Fate not to be involved) and a few of the current grad students.  Imagine, Danielle at MIT....</p>

				<p>Well, I&#39;m completing my second week at Aspiration. Monday and Tuesday were very interesting as I got to listen to the free training session we hosted for non-profits.  &quot;Web Sites for Advocacy and Community Organizing: Basics, Essentials, and Best Practices&quot;.  It was prepared by Gunner (from Aspiration) and David (from Radical Designs).</p>
<p> I couldn&#39;t help but listen as it took place 20 feet form my desk. :-)  It was incredibly informative and entertaining. We had about a dozen people here, and it seemed like everyone got a lot out of it. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, I&#39;ve been  working on developing a test plan for the Social Source Commons website.  I&#39;ve been looking for free tools to use for link-checking and QA testing.  I think I have a good plan, but if anyone has any suggestions I&#39;m all ears. </p>

				<p>Wow...I&#39;m glad everybody seems to be having a super-fun time in San Diego.   I&#39;ve spent the whole week updating 16 iBooks, using only a single installation disc, and a slow internet connection.  fun.</p>
<p> Also, I finally got around to applying for food stamps.  I&#39;m not sure how much they are giving me, but it&#39;s not going to be as much as I had hoped.  It turns out that if I had applied BEFORE the PSO, none of my &quot;living stipend&quot; would count as income, but having applied after my term of service began, it all counts as income.  Making me poor, but not poor enough.  </p>
<p>Lastly, as part of my work, I am researching digital distribution, and all kinds of crazy internet-y type stuff, so I decided to start my own vlog to get some hands-on experience.  If you want to check it out, go to <a href="http://www.kirstenacademy.blogspot.com" title="www.kirstenacademy.blogspot.com">www.kirstenacademy.blogspot.com</a>       There won&#39;t be any video clips until next week though. </p>

	    <p>I had a meeting with a couple other PCM folks last week, where we discussed the possibility of working with MNN (and a few other places around the country) on a digital distrubution network.  I don&#39;t know a whole lot about it yet, but I think something should be happening with that fairly soon.</p>

				<p><em>First Shot </em>- So this Monday will be my first day doing the bit that urgently matters in a minute-to-minute sort of way: working in one of our after school programs.  At the moment we&#39;re short of solid information but it looks like my co-worker (also a CTC VISTA) and I will be playing zone with 25 high school freshmen and somewhere between 0-5 video cameras in an effort to provide an interesting hands-on introduction to media production and digital storytelling.  We&#39;re attempting to do this by breaking things up into small groups with very specific aims (mini-missions) and augmenting the equipment with whatever we can scare up.  That means my beloved drum machine, an old digicam, my microphone and Google.  I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t have to resort to building birdhouses out of popsicle sticks.The process of tracking down the means of production (cameras, software, staff we&#39;re meant to be working with, potential volunteers) have actually made me start to understand what Donald Rumsfeld was talking about with all that &quot;known unknowns&quot; jive... see below, coaxed into poetic format courtesy of Slate (<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2081042/)" target="_blank">http://www.slate.com/id/2081042/)</a>:  The UnknownAs we know, There are known knowns. There are things we know we know. We also know There are known unknowns. That is to say We know there are some things We do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns, The ones we don&#39;t know We don&#39;t know.—Feb. 12, 2002, Department of Defense news briefingIf it survives the battlefield, I&#39;ll post the notes, general curriculum and lesson plans that I whipped up for the program.

<p>Also, I was meeting with some guys from <a href="http://acmeboston.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">ACME Boston</a> last night who are trying to do video blogging workshops with folks with no equipment, and we found some resources on the <a href="http://www.current.tv/make/training">Current.tv</a> site...click on the &quot;Film/Video Resources Near You&quot; link on the bottom (damn Flash menus mean no permalinks to content!).

				<p>I guess I&#39;ve been here two and a half weeks now; it feels so normal now that I&#39;m wondering what to say about it.</p>
<p>I get the impression that my organization (the California Coalition for Rural Housing, CCRH) is very different from most of the others. We&#39;re a suite of offices rather than a community center, and I haven&#39;t yet had any contact with the population we serve. Scratch that; our audience is the affordable housing community, rather than individuals. We work with groups like other affordable housing nonprofits, town governments, lobbyist groups, and tenants&#39; associations. So in terms of the people aspects of our work, sitting in on conference calls and going to meetings is where it&#39;s at (though hopefully I will be involved in some GIS trainings later in my service).</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty much treated like a regular employee here; my title is &quot;Community Technology Specialist&quot; &lt;brag&gt;and I&#39;ve got business cards to prove it.&lt;/brag&gt; I&#39;ve got an office with a desk, filing cabinets, and a computer, though I generally use my own because I&#39;m more comfortable with its tools.</p>
<p>During the first few days I met everyone who works here (or five of the six; Rob was out of town) and talked to them about what they work on. I read a few grants, and sat in on some meetings. And then my supervisor Darryl and I started talking about the website, which is my priority right now. It&#39;s currently a jumble of static html pages, most of which are broken and out of date. I&#39;m really excited about the ideas behind the redesign, and I&#39;ll definitely be blogging about it.</p>
<p>Also, I went to apply for <a href="http://circuitous.org/rebecca/2006/09/25/monday-paperwork/">food stamps on Monday</a>. For Californians on food stamps: there&#39;s a &quot;customer service&quot; number on the back of the EBT card; to talk to a person when you call that, don&#39;t enter your card number when prompted, just press #. And then press it again when it prompts you again. I was suprised that noone gave me any information on what I can and can&#39;t buy with food stamps, or a list of local stores that accept them, but supposedly I can get those questions answered at that customer service number. (Since when are we &quot;customers&quot; of the government...?)</p>

				<p>Good afternoon, all!  </p>
<p> So....even though volunteer recruitment has nothing to do with what I will be doing during my VISTA term, I&#39;d still like to blog about it because it&#39;s something I&#39;m really interested in overall.  During my first VISTA term (yup, this is year two of AmeriCorps for me), I found this to be quite useful since volunteer recruitment and management was one of my tasks.  The information comes from the following website where you can find lots more information on volunteering:  <a href="http://www.drcharity.com/voluntee.html">http://www.drcharity.com/voluntee.html</a></p>
<p><strong>15 Places to Recruit Volunteers</strong></p>
<p>1. Corporate newsletters</p>
<p>2. Schools and colleges</p>
<p>3. Retiree programs</p>
<p>4. Senior citizen centers</p>
<p>5. Corporate outplacement programs</p>
<p>6. Corporate volunteer programs</p>
<p>7. Churches, synagogues, and other places of worship</p>
<p>8.  Internship programs</p>
<p>9.  Career counseling services</p>
<p>10.  Civic clubs, fraternal societies, sororities</p>
<p>11.   Newspapers, radio, cable television</p>
<p>12.  Governmental organizations</p>
<p>13.  Court system</p>
<p>14.  Volunteer recruitment fairs</p>
<p>15.  Other nonprofit organizations</p>
<p>I have plenty of more information on volunteers that I will share in the future, but here&#39;s at least somewhere to start!  In case you&#39;re wondering where I got this information, I received a whole binder of information at my first PSO for my last VISTA position.  Who knows, maybe this whole binder will be up by the end of this year since I felt that the contents were helpful in getting me through my last year!</p>
<p>Hope everyone&#39;s doing well!</p>
<p>In service,</p>
<p>Laura</p>

				<p>Hey everybody!</p>
<p>First off, I tried to befriend as many of you as I could find on Facebook so if you did not get a request, it&#39;s probably because I spelled your name wrong, so find me instead :). Life in SD at Pangea Foundation is rockin&#39;. Laura and I have been having a blast. In fact, tonight we&#39;re going country line dancing, woo hoo! We&#39;ve been to the beach, Balboa Park, bike riding, walking around our little city and had all sorts of adventures in getting lost. We&#39;re working with a mentoring program right now, developing software. We are considered &quot;software architects.&quot; How cool is that? This weekend we get to hang out with Andrea (from PSO) because she&#39;s heading up the AIDS walk. The goof troop is re-uniting! Our office is super-sweet. Everyone is helpful and really generous. We have taco Tuesdays and because everyone here is male besides us they bought 39 tacos last time..... we were pretty full. I think we even get a free trip to Disneyland sometime in the near future because the clients we serve all have a crush on our supervisor so he gets the hook-ups. But yeah, life is pretty sweet. I hope all is going well for everyone else!</p>

	    <p>What a spectacular nickname you have chosen for yourself! I could never have come up with something like that.<br />Yeh for goof-troop reunions! I&#39;m pumped you guys are having so much fun.</p>
<p>Its awesome how you ended up with the exact opposite office dynamic than I did.  Only male, youngest by 10 years and everybody is married, so no sweet escapades to disneyland.  I guess we could all take fun trips to the Smithsonians. Those are DC&#39;s Disneyland. Big difference though......they&#39;re FREE! hahaha, in your face disney.</p>
<p>Life here is good, the Computer CORE is actually a great place. I actually was finally bequeathed a title the other day, which i&#39;m pretty pumped about...Computer Training Development Coordinator &lt;brag&gt;.  Its pretty hot. Oh man, I forgot to change the voicemail on my phone. Anyway, my supervisor(s) is quite great and is interested in my professional development, developing my network, and giving me <em>real</em> responsibilities.  Its alot like i&#39;m the real deal and not just a federally paid intern.  I&#39;m milking all of my pre-existing friends here for their free food and drink and trying to stretch the almighty DC metro dollar. It doesnt go that far, but I&#39;m making my way. </p>
<p>Hello other goofs and all other wonderful VISTAs. I&#39;m glad the blogging is going well. I&#39;ll try to contribute more. </p>

Anyway i lived off less. after all i wasnt working for the whole summer. hopefully the nearby shelter  will supply me with dinner until the next check.

	    <p>Will, the checks we just got are only for two days, because the pay period was Aug 29 to Sept 11th and we all started on the 8th. So, Paul said we&#39;d get 20% of our regular checks. mine was only $75 and due to me giving Paul the wrong number for my account I haven&#39;t gotten it yet. </p>
<p>Our next check will be on October 9th and should be much better, if still not a lot. </p>

<p>Well I did not update last week. I have been pretty busy with getting situated down this way. I had my motorcycle go down last week and I had to turn to peddling my way around town. Thank goodness Tempe is a &quot;bicycle friendly&quot; community. I can say I have never been in a place that consistently stays hot. We finally dropped down to the low nineties during the day. First day I came here it was 104 degrees. Arizona is a crazy place....you can drive an hour north of here and it could be in the 60s during the day. </p>
<p> Now for what I have been doing. I started work at the Boys and Girls Club of the East Valley-Ladmo Branch. I will have to get used to that because I am in Tempe and we have two specific branches just in Tempe. The North Branch and the Ladmo Branch. I have been trying to start to get some instructing going in a computer lab that has pretty much been a free for all. The Boys and Girls club has a very open policy. The members are allowed to float between areas if they wish. I have to try to get some instruction going while I have members in and out of the lab at will. I also have to deal with member coming to the lab when it is not their turn. It seems easy to get the instruction going but very hard so far to keep the students organized such that they will actually stay to hear what me and the instructor have to say. I am having a difficult time with the members being on Internet websites that they are not supposed to be on. Some of the older members were bypassing the filters with a proxy website. It seems as if its a thin line to toe but I am doing my best. I guess the hardest part is to get the members to understand that this is a place of instruction before a place to play video games. </p>

Ideally, this website will be a source of information about new products and upsdates to existing products, as well as pointing to help and documentation about products.  Hopefully, the content will be user supplied and maintained, with minimal input form us.  It&#39;s still in the Beta testing phase, so we could always use some new eyes to look at it and try it out.  Let me know how you think it can be improved and made more useful.</p>

				<p class="MsoNormal">I have officially been working with HPP for almost two weeks now.<span>  </span>Besides becoming formally oriented with the organization, I have spearheaded a couple of interesting projects.<span>  </span>My host organization, formally titled <a href="http://www.homelessprenatal.org/">Homeless Prenatal Program</a> although everyone calls it HPP, is made up many smaller departments: Community Health Worker Training, Wellness Program, Substance Abuse, Childcare Center and the Technology Center.<span>  </span>I am working in the technology center as a tech specialist.<span>  </span>I have also been assigned to being the volunteer coordinator.<span>  </span>At this moment there is nothing to formally monitor and organize volunteers.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Everyone in the organization is super friendly; I have even dined out with a couple of the staff members.<span>  </span>I’m attributing this smooth adjustment to my boss because she has made a substantial effort to ensure that everyone in the organization knows who I am and what my role will be at HPP.<span>  </span>After only two weeks, I already feel like I belong here, staff members go out of their way to say hello to me!<span>     </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As for my projects, I currently have three different tangents for my own work in addition to the training help and website updates that I supply in the lab.<span>  </span>First, I am looking at creating an electronic volunteer management system, that will either be online or through Access.<span>  </span>This database will allow HPP to organize their volunteers more effectively.<span>  </span>My other project is to create some sort of online portal through some CMS (maybe Drupal, but I am also exploring others) specifically for case managers.<span>  </span>We have a website called <a href="http://www.helping-sf.org/">helping-sf</a> that will be used as a starting point for some organization and content, but I am just beginning the design process.<span>  </span>If anyone has any suggestions for training, either online or otherwise, I would love to hear about them.<span>  </span>Ideally, HPP would like to be able to expand this resource to the entire San Francisco community if everything goes well in the testing phase.<span>  </span>Lastly, I am going to try to strengthen the connections between the numerous community technology centers and vocational services in SF.<span>  </span>I am looking into working with the SF WiFi project and other local community technology groups.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mostly, San Francisco is amazing and there are many cheap and free events all over the city.<span>  </span>Check out: <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/funcheapSF/">funcheapSF</a> for more! </p>
<p> <br />
</p><p class="MsoNormal">I must go.<span>  </span>I have to help with a tech class in Spanish.<span>  </span>Oh how I wish I could speak Spanish fluently!<span>  </span>I suppose that I am working on it.<span>  </span><span>   </span><span> </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the air gets colder in Boston, it&#39;s that time once again...the <strong>Digest </strong>is coming, the <strong>Digest </strong>is coming.  Here&#39;s some details: </p>
<p><strong>History: </strong></p>
<p> The Digest, as the newsletter is known, is a Project specific publication based on the content we used to  produce in the professional journal, the <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/fall-2005/">Community Technology Review </a> (which is now on hiatus indefinitely). CTR was filled with contributions from all volunteer authors as well but had much longer pieces and was printed.  There also used to be a tiny <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/newsletters/">newsletter </a>produced by VISTA leaders.</p>
<p> The Digest is the next generation of news about the Project.  It has the goal of highlighting the work of the VISTAs and accomplishments of our participating organizations.  As Peter stated in the intro to the first issue of the <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/digest/?q=node/72">Digest in May of 2006 </a>:</p>
<p> &quot;Developed using Drupal content management system tools, the Digest allows us to present the kind of substantial content the Project has provided in the past via the Community Technology Review—organized from a limitless number of perspectives, and we have chosen here themes of news, trends and reports in our focus area work, and blogs—with special takes on those focus areas: community networking, TA to NPOs , community organizing, and digital media for youth (for more categories, check out the tag cloud).&quot; </p>
<p> The last issue of the Digest is at &lt; <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/digest/">http://www. cpcs . umb . edu /vista/digest/ </a>&gt;.</p>
<p><strong>Articles: </strong></p>
<p> All the content of the Digest is original to the Project, whether it is new articles or excerpts from VISTA blogs. In the past we&#39;ve aimed for articles of 600-800 words (but sometime longer) on topics specific to the work the VISTAs are doing in their organizations.  Articles fall into sections such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>News - Articles written by VISTAs, Project HQ staff, and supervisors about news about the Project itself and events at our participating organizations (especially highlighting the work of VISTAs) </li>
<li>Trends &amp; Reports - articles by outside experts, friends of the Project about trends/topics related to work of the VISTAs, primarily in the four priority areas.  also includes updates based on mid-year and end of year reports. </li>
<li>From the blogs - excerpts of entries by VISTAs in their CTC VISTA blogs, including photos </li>
<li>Wall of Video - links to videos made by, related to, or were a result of VISTA&#39;s programs </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>  Deadlines for Fall 2006:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rough Draft deadline: 10/13 </strong></li>
<li> Final Draft deadline: 10/20 </li>
<li> Production week: 10/23-27 </li>
<li> Full issue out online - out around 10/30 </li>
</ol>
<p> <strong>Call for authors: </strong></p>
<p> ANYONE can be a writer for the Digest - new &amp; current VISTAs, supervisors, alumni VISTAs, and even friends of the Project.  Please contact <a href="contact.html">Danielle or Erin </a> at Project HQ if you&#39;re interested.  It&#39;s a great chance to get published and get the word out about your organizations. </p>

				<p>The new VISTA website looks phenomenal- much props to the creators.</p>
<p>Life at Project: Think Different has been going well.  Currently, I am working on a brand new media literacy series that we will be teaching to youth around Boston. It is co-created with our Media Watch Team- a part-time staff of teens (ages 16-19) that are working to become media literacy buffs! I am really excited about it; I think the work is extremely accessible for inner-city kids. We have a focus on hip-hop and movies and have really geared the curriculum towards the &quot;cool factor&quot;. I sound like such an idiot saying that, but it&#39;s true.</p>
<p>Our pilot sites for the s0-called &quot;Media Action Series&quot; are: the Blue Hill Boys and Girls Club, Write Boston (Teen-In-Print), and the Hip Hop Mecca Project. </p>
<p>I will be the &quot;adult&quot; facilitator at our workshops. I put &quot;adult&quot; in quotes because, really, I am only a handful of years older than this amazing, dynamic teens. </p>
<p>I wonder if I should copy the text from my other blog and post it here? That might make more sense to have all my posts in one place. Not like I have that many- I have only posted 4 times. I am so lame. </p>
