				<p>hi there.  Spring is in the air here!  And it&#39;s already humid.   Everything at Media Bridges is going alright.  Though our state senate just introduced a devastating bill to public access, consumer choice and all that stuff.  Am I allowed to talk about that?  well, anyways. </p>
<p>Today I finished a mini grant for a summer media camp.  It was a short short grant but good experience to write up descriptions and form some budgets.  By the way, if you are writing a grant, you&#39;re a volunteer, not a staff person and that looks really nice to the grant people.  We&#39;ll do the camp regardless if we get the money, since it&#39;s already in the budget, but more money is always nice for equipment and foooooood.   </p>
<p>I started an outreach with an afterschool youth center last week.  Nice kids and they love love love the camera.  Everyone wants to be on camera.  Yesterday, after finishing filming the footage for the movie about the center, the group of kids broke out into an impromptu rap.  With beats, background vocals and raps and all.  I think we&#39;ll add that footage during the credits.  They&#39;ve been more excited about the extra footage and getting bloopers than the actual content.  Go figure.  </p>
<p>Another group I&#39;m working with decided that they want to make a documentary about motorcycles.  Several of their teachers have motorcycles (I think most of them are former NFL players, no kidding, it&#39;s a great high school football school).  They also plan on getting some motorcycle &#39;cliques&#39; to do tricks but we&#39;ll see if that happens. </p>
<p> I&#39;ve also been working on writing our youth media program policies, particularly our internship policies.  I actually had an intern under me for a few months, but that all went sour.  Part of the problem was that I never laid the boundaries or explained even the hierarchy of our organization.  Good learning experience though it was a nightmare as it was happening.  I hope these policies and guidelines will prevent future problems.  And if anybody has any suggestions or their org has some written intern policies, please help.    </p>
<p>And that should do it.   Oh - and thanks to karl for the badass bike website.  I&#39;m planning to start biking to work and based on that map, the elevation and the calories burned, i think i can drop my ywca membership (which i never use anyways).  super.   </p>

			 	<a href="node/661.html" title="Network Topology Summary" rel="bookmark"><h1>Network Topology Summary</h1></a>
			 				 	
			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p>I received a comment on my last blog entry that made me realize that perhaps I needed to start on a more basic level. Rather than identifying the benefits and shortcomings of a particular wireless mesh solution, I need to identify what the issues are for community wireless networks.</p>
<p>The issue that  sparked the comment is a question of network topology. Before you completely zone out, give me a paragraph to explain topology. It&#39;s pretty easy to explain, I think, and then we can address further issues.</p>
<p>Computer networks are about creating connections between various locations. Locations, whether they are computers or geographic locations, are often referred to as nodes. The way that nodes are connected to one another is the network topology. Diagrams that indicate the ways that the locations are referred to as topologies. Take a look at Diagram 1. I&#39;ve diagramed three network topologies, each having its own unique characteristics.</p>
<div id="diagram1"><img src="http://digitalartscorps.org/files/user804/bus.gif" alt="Bus Topology" title="Bus Topology" width="200" height="200" /><img src="http://digitalartscorps.org/files/user804/star.gif" alt="Star Topology" title="Star Topology" width="200" height="200" /><img src="http://digitalartscorps.org/files/user804/mesh.gif" alt="Mesh Topology" title="Mesh Topology" width="200" height="200" /><br />
<h5>Diagram 1</h5>
</div>
<p>What is important in this discussion is the ramifications of each topology. Networks that use the bus topology (left) are very vulnerable to failure. A break in the line may halt all communication on the network. The star topology (center) is less vulnerable to a single break in the network, as a break in one line only cuts off one node. The drawback is that the network is completely dependent on the central node, which may fail or reach its capacity. The mesh network (right) is the most fault-tolerant, as a break in any one line doesn&#39;t mean that the connection to any node is lost. Unfortunately, it is also the most expensive, or at least it is the most expensive solution for wired networks. For more information about the various topologies, take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<h3>Wireless Networks</h3>
<p>Wireless networks almost always use one of these three topologies, but the language is sometimes different. Wireless bus topologies are often called point-to-point. Star topologies in wireless networks are usually referred to as point-to-multipoint. Mesh, fortunately, is still mesh.</p>
<p>For wireless networks, meshing does not have the high overhead that it does for wired networks. If one combines the fault-tolerance of a mesh network and with cost-effectiveness, one can easily appreciate why community networks that are interested in wireless are excited about mesh.</p>
<p>In a follow-up post, I hope to outline the wireless solutions that are aimed at community networks. For now, this should suffice to explain the basics of network topology.</p>

	    <p>Kevin,</p>
<p> There are other ways. CUWiN has a solution. There is a project through Rice University that is developing what I understand to be a wireless mesh system, although I am frankly less familiar with that project than I ought to be.</p>
<p> Hope this helps. </p>

				<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p> Anyone out there have one of those pesky &quot;pre-existing conditions&quot; that our benefits prefer not to cover? Well, I did, and it was time to fulfill a prescription (for a measly, oh, $150!) so it came time to find some alternatives! </p>
<p>Anyway, my doctor turned me on to a &quot;patient assistance&quot; program. Basically, I searched online for the website of the company that manufactures the medication I needed and then sent them an email explaining my financial situation. I received a reply the next day complete with information on patient assistance programs and an application to be completed by my doctor and myself. A completed application, attached tax forms and a month of waiting later and I am happy to say I received a little medical card from the company giving me my prescription for FREE! Booyah! </p>
<p>Hope this helps anyone out there who might have a similar issue. Good luck! </p>

				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Everything’s going quite well here at NTEN as we’re of course very busy tying up all the loose ends before the NTC.<span>  </span>As far as what&#39;s new and exciting in my work, I finally managed to make a breakthrough in using our sometimes unwieldy CMS (netFORUM) to design a searchable member database for our website.<span>  </span>That project had been on my plate since the beginning of January (and until yesterday I’d made very little progress), so it was nice to finally make some real headway there - and it should soon be up on our website and ready for use.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Outside of work I’m loving the longer days and beautiful weather out here in the Bay Area.<span>  </span>Last weekend I went on a really cool bike ride down in Santa Cruz.<span>  </span>Looking at the map beforehand we had thought the route was maybe 7 miles with maybe 600 feet of elevation gain.<span>  </span>After the ride though (which at points was quite exhausting), my friend pointed me towards a very cool website that lets you track the actual distance of any path, anywhere in the world, and also creates an elevation map of said path (using the wonderful google maps interface).<span>  </span>So after playing around with this, it turned out that instead of our planned 7 mile ride, we actually had gone close to 13 miles with nearly 1,000 feet of elevation gain (here’s the link to see our actual route: </span><a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=785895" target="_blank">http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=785895</a><span>) ... so it was a much more difficult ride than we were planning on, especially after several months of winter inactivity.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Well, that’s about it from here, so I hope everyone else&#39;s work is going well and I’ll see many of you in a couple weeks at the NTC,</span></p>

				<p><span>Mornin&#39; folks, </span></p>
<p><span>I actually made a connection between something I learned in school and my VISTA project!  This is exciting news because my degree is in audiology and speech-language pathology, so the only computer class I took was during my first semester of my freshman year, which was an intro level course that focused on how to use Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.  I&#39;m sure that there are some indirect connections between my project and schooling, but to discover a direct connection – enough so for me to realize and really think about it – is indeed exciting.</span></p>
<p><span>I was fortunate enough to be a part of a project for two semesters during my time at Purdue.  Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) is a program in which teams of students design, build, and deploy systems to solve engineering-based problems for local community service and education organizations (taken from the <a href="http://epics.ecn.purdue.edu/" target="_blank">EPICS website</a>). It is a neat, neat program because it exposes students to real-life situations and working on projects that will be used in the community.  I certainly am no engineer, but there was still a place for me in EPICS.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the community partners for EPICS at Purdue is the speech-language and audiology clinic (SLAC) at Purdue; perfect for an audiology major!  However, since I was a part of it for just two semesters, I only got to work very briefly on two projects. DHA, or Directional Hearing Aid, was the most interesting one to me in which we were designing an affordable hearing aid that cancels out background noise so that a person with a hearing impairment can have a conversation in a noisy environment.  Sort of like reading glasses...the point isn&#39;t to replace hearing aids, but to help out those who may not be able to afford a hearing aid, or just need a little help in amplifying speech.</span></p>
<p><span>Anyways, being a member EPICS taught me the importance of documentation.  Since I wasn&#39;t one of the more technical members of the team, I focused on documentation and human subjects testing for the product.  The whole human subjects testing process, although interesting, is a very slow one, so I focused most of my time and attention towards documentation, documentation, documentation.  Documenting steps, tasks, processes, etc for future reference was my number one priority; most of my grade was based on how well I documented things.  Tedious and always put off until the last minute, it was not something I neither enjoyed nor understood the point of. </span></p>
<p><span>Since starting my VISTA position, however, I understand why it’s so important.<span>  </span>Testing our software is one of my more usual tasks here at the Pangea Foundation.<span>  </span>With testing comes discovering bugs and having to report those bugs. I write them up and report them to our technical director and track them on a spreadsheet we use for easy reference (rather than having to sort through lots of emails) to see what has been resolved and what&#39;s still outstanding.<span>  </span>In addition to the spreadsheet, all steps to recreate the bug are documented so that when re-testing past bugs, steps can be reproduced exactly to determine if the bug has in fact been resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>I know it doesn’t really seem like a big deal, but it saves so much time and (I like to think) makes everyone’s job so much easier that it’s well worth it.<span>  </span>I certainly hope that past, current, and future SLACers have found my documentation easy to understand and useful in continuing the project.</span></p>
<p><span>P.S. – Want to know something that’s extra cool? (If not, you’re done and can leave at any time…) <a href="http://www.learnandserve.org/" target="_blank">Learn &amp; Serve</a> (a different program of the Corporation for National and Community Service – that’s what AmeriCorps is also under) recently gave Purdue a grant to start EPICS programs for high school students! One of the partnering universities is San Diego and two high schools here were selected to be a part of the program.<span>  </span>I think I’ll shoot an email to the contact person right now and see if there’s anyway I can get involved, being an EPICS alum an all. :)</span></p>

				<p>*The following would have been posted last month if I didn&#39;t constantly close Firefox in mid-blog* </p>
<p>I have no idea what the heck they&#39;re working on next door but they&#39;re certainly doing a great job of constructing it as loudly as possible.  It would be one thing if it was a steady-state din, but instead there will be a long stretch of quiet, followed by an ear-splitting CLANG! as someone (I&#39;m guessing) starts taking a sledgehammer to a very massive, VERY resonant object.  There&#39;s also the deafening buzz of a chopsaw gnawing through metal the very moment you start to get your concentration back, as well as the desk-rattling jackhammer to add insult to injury.  To make matters worse, when they have a radio playing its top-40 stuff.  Not like I have anything against popular music, I just don&#39;t want Ashlee Simpson as the musical backdrop to this chaotic production.  Call me a purist, if you will.</p>
<p>Anyway, the big news of the past couple of weeks has been the arrival of 14 new computers.  I say a couple of weeks instead of a week because Dell certainly did their part in making sure I had plenty of work to do.  It didn&#39;t start off too bad.  I did get bounced to 3 different sales reps (due to the quantity), none of whom could cut us much of a break (so much for a karma discount) and had some annoyances putting together a quote, but nothing I wouldn&#39;t normally expect.  When the systems finally arrived (no hitches yet), I pulled them out and noticed the CPU sticker only denoted an AMD64, and not the 64X2 dual core that I had specified.  Fired it up noticed the BIOS listed the CPU as the 64.  Not cool.</p>
<p>After looking over the invoice, it turns out that we did, in fact, get the correct systems.  However, the systems magically changed from 64X2s on the quote to plain-old-64s on the order.  Blarg.  About an hour and a dozen phone transfers later we finally arranged to the dual-core systems sent.  They arrived without incident, and also without return labels for the old systems.  Cripes.  Another hour and a few more phone transfers later, we finally arranged for another pickup the next day.  Fast forward 24 hours, and the Fedex man is here with 8 shipping slips in hand.  Wait a sec...8 slips...14 computers...KHAAAAAN!!!</p>
<p>A couple of days later, everything resolved itself and we all lived happily ever after, until it came time to order mounting systems. We wanted to mount the computers under the tables and elevated from the ground.  While not unheard of, this wasn&#39;t particularly common so of course nobody locally had anything.  Most online sources had units starting at $60-80ish, with the most simple units consisting of mounting plates for the table and straps to suspend the computers from the table.  Not exactly kid-proof, but the alternative were designs that featured drawer slides and swivels, so the strapping method won by default.  </p>
<p>When it came time to order the mounts though, the lead time was pretty long and we already had volunteers lined up to help install the computers, so rather than arrange for rush shipping when we probably wouldn&#39;t get the units in time anyway, I cobbled together a knock-off from tie-plates, tiedown straps, and drywall screws.  It used 3x7&quot; tie-plates to hold the straps against the bottom of the table.  Then, an old mouse pad was taped over the plate with some double-sided carpet tape.  After cinching the straps as tightly as possible, the excess looped around the end on both sides and tied onto the other side of the strap as a safety measure.  The remaining ends were cut and fused.  To make the catches tamper resistant, wedges were cut from shim stock, sprayed black to match, then put into place and secured with cable ties.  Not exactly foolproof, but good enough.</p>
<p>Between the smaller footprint of the LCDs, the under-table mounting, and some cable organization, the lab looks much cleaner all-in-all.  Wish I could say all the kids loved it.  A few really were wide-eyed and overjoyed, but most others just kinda shrugged, said &#39;meh&#39; and went back to their regularly scheduled YouTube viewing.  *sigh*  </p>
<p>Installation was smooth and easy thanks to the imaging process, although our inital attempt at imaging a dual-boot XP/Vista install didn&#39;t go over particularly well.  Alright, so it didn&#39;t work at all.  That plus the lack of support for Deep Freeze and we&#39;re looking at a purely XP setup on most of the computers.  4 computers were manually set up with a dual-boot just for kicks.  While it&#39;ll leave a big, gaping Deep-Freeze exploit, I&#39;d be tickled to death if our kids were savvy enough to take advantage of it.</p>

	    <p>Wow...way to problem solve; excellent job!  When reading your description of how you mounted the computers, I was having a difficult time imaging what you were talking about (because I don&#39;t know what half the things you used are) and was thinking to myself, &quot;If only I could see a picture.&quot;  Lo and behold, to my pleasant surprise you were one step ahead of me!  Way to be resourceful!  Anyway, even if this kids aren&#39;t, <em>I&#39;m </em>impressed. :)</p>

	    <p>Wow, way to overcome adversity! Amazing job with the mounting, a true engineer. I hope you can get that dual boot up and running; I&#39;ve only ever done a dual boot on a Mac, so I have no idea how it would work with XP and Vista. Good luck though! And sorry about the chronic Ashlee Simpson prob =)</p>

				<p>I&#39;m back on the blog tip. We didn&#39;t have the net for a few weeks due to some funding issues. I had my own funding issues and I&#39;m holding on with my finger tips, but its all good!   We are in full effect at Jordan high located in Watts and I&#39;m proud to be apart of such a life transforming project.  The kids are really picking up video production fast and Ill post some of the project&#39;s as soon as they are done.  </p>
<p>Today I picked up a donated computer which will be used for a community information Kiosk.  I&#39;m still in the process of creating some content for the Kiosk. It will be information that will help serve the community here... you know ...health issues, where to find help and government services, local sports and the finished video projects from the students in the program. we gettin it crackin (done, for those who don&#39; speak..you know) LOL</p>

				<p><a href="http://meraki.net/">Meraki</a>, a spin-off of <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/roofnet/doku.php">MIT Roofnet</a>, has been the darling of the community and municipal networking sector for the past year. The fervor hit hyperspeed last month when Meraki received <a href="http://meraki.net/news/2007/02/05/meraki-networks-closes-sequoia-capital-led-5-million-series-a-funding/">$5 million in venture capital</a> from Sequoia Capital, largely backed by Google. This capital injection has vaulted Meraki into the driver&#39;s seat for creating &quot;low-cost&quot; wireless mesh networks.</p>
<p>For years, community networking has been stunted by the high cost of single board computers, the vital hardware that provides the network. Some organizations, like <a href="http://cuwin.net/">the CUWiN Foundation</a>, have tried to build wireless backbones out of older computers, which most often has had disappointing results. A very small, very affordable mesh router is the holy grail for community and municipal networking. But does Meraki&#39;s signature item, the Meraki Mini, deliver the goods?</p>
<h3>Meraki&#39;s Success</h3>
<p>Meraki&#39;s success in attracting investors is the result of good engineering. With a price point of $50 for the internal model and $99 for the outdoor model, Meraki has done a fine job of creating a small, cheap wireless router. With their planned network in San Francisco, Meraki stands poised to demonstrate that a wide-area mesh network is possible using their hardware and a closed version of Roofnet&#39;s software.</p>
<p>Meraki&#39;s most impressive success has been marketing. They have received adoration of the main stream media, including the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/04/business/yourmoney/04digi.html">New York Times</a>. When I was in India for the WISFII Summit in October, Meraki was all the rage as well. And now pundits like <a href="http://www.bwianews.com/2007/03/meraki_another_.html">Steve Stroh</a> are touting the miracle of Meraki&#39;s mesh, brushing aside any consideration of &quot;the limitations of this particular hardware implementation.&quot;</p>
<h3>Don&#39;t Believe the Hype</h3>
<p>In its original business model, Meraki advertized itself as open architecture, encouraging several different software organizations and companies to use the product. Since the announcement of venture capital, all reference to open source or open architecture has disappeared from their website. This suggests that Meraki is no longer interested in supporting various software solutions, which is a mistake if you ask me. Part of that mistake is in closing off their source, but the biggest part of their miscalculation is that they are relying on technology that does not conform to common networking standards like IP, standards that form the basis of the Internet as we know it.</p>
<p>Perhaps more damning are the actual limitations on Meraki&#39;s hardware. As Stroh correctly points out, Meraki has chosen to optimize for price. I have no problem with that strategy as long as people understand the compromises that are being made. People don&#39;t understand what those compromises are because they aren&#39;t being presented with that information.</p>
<p>The most obvious compromise is power. In urban areas, the lack of power on the radios is probably beneficial, as it reduces interference. For rural areas, power is essential, as residences are considerably farther apart. When Meraki markets their outdoor product as &quot;Into the wild. Rural or urban.&quot;, they are falsely advertising their product. For most of the rural deployments I work with, Meraki products are simply not an option.</p>
<p>An additional cause for concern, especially for community and municipal networks, is long-term sustainability. Meraki&#39;s products are complete units, with everything soldered right onto the board. When 802.11n or 802.11s (the mesh networking protocol) become available standards, purchasers of the Meraki Mini will either be forced to purchase a completely new product or they will be stuck using outdated technology. How happy citizens will be when a city rolls out a Meraki network, only to find that next year they have to spend the same amount or more to keep up with technology? The kind of revolt that suggests could very well spell the end of municipal networks. </p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Meraki&#39;s wireless mesh routers are not bad products, but they aren&#39;t the solution that they claim to be. The Mini is a cheap wireless mesh hardware that has been compromised by the gradual alienation of open source alternatives to Meraki&#39;s software. Moreover, the hardware is unable to provide the long-term sustainability or the coverage required by rural networks. If you live in one of the world&#39;s densely populated cities, Meraki has delivered a great product for your networking needs today. Just don&#39;t think about next year.</p>

	    <p>Hi Ross,</p>
<p> Your blog is pretty interesting but I was a little confused on what a mesh network is. It sounds like it&#39;s going to be a city-wide wireless connection that is available to all as long as one has the correct hardware. Is that true?</p>
<p> Thanks! </p>

	    <p>Corey,  I just posted another entry that explains mesh. Hopefully it helps. However, ubiquitous coverage, as you describe in your comment, is problematic on several levels, most importantly cost. I&#39;ll try to parse these items out in future posts. </p>

				<p>I have been given the task to increase the viewership and participation in <a href="http://www.sflregionalequity.org/">www.sflregionalequity.org</a>  (a website dedicated to achieving greater equity in the Southeast Florida region through promoting and enabling affordable housing, transit-oriented development, stronger neighborhoods, and equal access to education and health). </p>
<p>I believe in the cause and I <em>think</em> demand for the website is out there. However, I did not know how to best get the word out. At first I spent approximately 60 hours identifying 1800 possible organizations and local activists who would possibly be interested in the purpose of the site. I then went ahead and emailed and snail mailed invitations to the website with very little response. I believe that of the 1800 pieces of mailings I received 2 phone calls and 7 emails. So that tactic did not get the results I was hoping for.</p>
<p>Next, I decided to create an e-newsletter through Constant Contact. The Collins Center already has an account with them so there is no additional cost to the website. Otherwise, It would cost over $300 a year to run the newsletter. However, I can not use my current email list to send out newsletters because if a certain percentage unsubscribe from the newsletter the account will be cancelled, thereby ruining the service for the whole organization (Constant Contact has a strict NO-SPAM policy). So that tactic could possibly produce the desired results, but it could also get me in some hot water with the Collins Center if the service gets cancelled.</p>
<p>After I spent some time reviewing my ineffective attempts, it became clear that the website needs an informed and focused marketing plan. I scheduled a &quot;Marketing for Nonprofits&quot; seminar this week that the Collins Center was gracious enough to pay for, but one seminar can only do so much. The website is in serious need of tried-and-true marketing strategies that work, and I plain have no expertise in marketing. </p>
<p>Therefore my plan is to a) gain knowledge of basic marketing principles; b) identify best practices for marketing websites; and c) choose one or a combination of best practices to implement.</p>
<p>If anyone else has the assignment of increasing participation in a website or project and would like to share your experience let me know! I think working on similar projects and having others share their input really helps, and it makes the whole process more enjoyable.</p>

	    <p>The only way to &quot;sell&quot; a website is on its content. I think that one of the most effective ways to get people using a website is to use it to answer their questions. I don&#39;t know what sort of org you work at or how much networking you do (by email, in person, at conferences, at community tech trainings), but if you know the content of the website, you can bring up ideas from it in conversations and add, &quot;I&#39;ll email you a link.&quot; if they&#39;re interested. If people pass bits and pieces of a website on to their coworkers or people they work with, it&#39;s not only &quot;selling&quot; the website, it&#39;s people actually making use of the content (which is [hopefully] the real point behind getting the word out).</p>
<p> If you&#39;re trying to spread the word about a website, &quot;inreach&quot; can be as important as outreach... do people in your organization use the website? If people within the organization are reading the website and casually passing links on to colleagues (the way links show up here on this blog and in our wiki, though most people would do that via email), or if they are using articles to introduce outsiders to their work, it shows a real ownership of the content. People will be much more willing to check out a website that is directly related to something specific that they&#39;re doing/thinking about/talking about. And if people within your organization aren&#39;t sold on the site... how are outsiders supposed to be sold on it? uh, what I mean by that is, find the good parts and pass them on. </p>
<p> Maybe that&#39;s too much person-to-person interaction/work... but content and people are the most important things, and have to be in it somewhere. HTH.</p>

	    <p>Those are some good thoughts!  I suppose why this has been so challenging is because I have no real experience in urban planning (the content of the website) and in marketing. </p>
<p>I guess what I should do is focus on getting the word out while at the same time collect useful information, put it on the website, and educate myself on the issues at hand. That way I could actually conduct a conversation about it when out in public, which would reinforce the marketing of the site overall.</p>
<p> Its coming together slowly but surely.</p>

	    <p>Perhaps prominent local media - TV, Radio, Newspaper<br />
interviews.  </p>
<p>Almost everyone likes a good human interest story.</p>
<p>Your NP is certainly a good fit.</p>
<p>That would also be high profile.</p>
<p>Use low / no cost outlets.</p>
<p>  - if you haven't already, consider adding your<br />
    web page link to your email signature and having<br />
    co-workers add it to theirs</p>
<p>  - Register with <a href="http://www.goodsearch.com" title="www.goodsearch.com">www.goodsearch.com</a> and add that to<br />
    your signature.  (As an alternative to my previous<br />
    suggestion).  Not only publicity but fundraising<br />
    as well.</p>
<p>  - Indirect visibility - Flickr, Yahoo Answers, Yahoo,<br />
    or Google Groups (on relevant topics / subjects)<br />
    Find (or start) relevant groups, post relevant pictures<br />
    etc.</p>
<p>  - Post info at local public locations - Post Offices,<br />
    Libraries, Churches, etc.</p>
<p>  - Sponsorships, get others to advertise, advocate your<br />
    cause - force multipliers - local events</p>
<p>  - Get a silly suit, stand on a busy corner with a sign<br />
    and broadcast your website to rush hour traffic</p>
<p>  - Get kids to volunteer, they've got time and energy<br />
    and maybe some good ideas</p>
<p>  - Give people a daily, weekly, monthly (periodic) reason<br />
    to come back to your website - it's all about content</p>
<p>  - What are other local, regional, national orgs doing<br />
    to promote their websites - what ideas can you cost<br />
    effectively (legally) copy?</p>
<p>Just a few off the top of my head...</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

	    <p>hi kevin - </p>
<p> seems like you&#39;ve got a lot of good advice.  I was on techsoup.org the other day (great technology resource for nonprofits... you may already know).  Here&#39;s an article about marketing your website, though it&#39;s just repeating what&#39;s already been said.  But anyways, here it is: <a href="http://www.techsoup.org/learningcenter/webbuilding/page5958.cfm">http://www.techsoup.org/learningcenter/webbuilding/page5958.cfm</a></p>
<p> Also, people may not know the resources you offer.  Maybe try a targeted marketing campaign (that&#39;s a marketing class term).  Contact the affordable housing orgs and let them know what&#39;s available.  And do the same with the other &quot;targets&quot; or &quot;niches&quot;</p>
<p>Last year I worked at an affordable housing org too.  People just didn&#39;t know that there was usable info and stats and help and all that available.   I&#39;d also suggest to try and get write ups about the site in other organization&#39;s newsletters.  It may be small fries, but it&#39;s a spreading the word campaign.   </p>

				<p>First off let me say I&#39;m sorry for not keeping up with this but it&#39;s been crazy here at the Cyber Cafe. We started back in December with questions about our stability here at this location. Because we are operating under the help of a partnership. We have had some troubles with certain partners keeping up with rent, or electricity, phone...   the like. We had some partners that cant pay there own bills never-mind help with ours. One of our biggest helpers is the State Representatives office which is joined to ours. We had heard a rumor that he might be running for Mayor and that he would not be using the office anymore, so we were a little nervous. That is no longer an issue. </p>
<p>A new semester of citizen schools is starting and I have been told that the new apprenticeships are fantastic. Do to time constraints I am unable to teach  this semester but I have helped on a couple of projects.</p>
<p>501 tech club is still a big part of my constant search for more online resources. It&#39;s always good to meet people with the same interests and the same thirst for knowledge. </p>
<p>I&#39;m keeping my trackstar.4teachers.org web-page up to date. If your helping with resumes there is some fantastic information.</p>
<p>The Cyber Cafe is now a full VITA site (Volunteer Income Tax Assistant). We have done about 20 tax preps so far and all seems well. We have had our first check up from the IRS to see how we are doing and we passed. By the way here is a reminder to get those taxes done soon and remember you most likely are eligible for the earned income credit or EIC. I did mine and got back 400$ so look in to it.</p>
<p>GCF Learn free has updated it page and added some new tutorials. If your interested in learning more about Excell, Acsess, Powerpoint, Word, ect.</p>
<p>I think that catches me up to date so if you have any questions please feel free to ask me. or you could contact me at <a href="mailto:willmart64@yahoo.com">willmart64@yahoo.com</a></p>

Now we arent talking about a 100, or even 300 files. We are talking about 5500 files. It is going to be a long ride, but I will eventually get there. Now u are probaly thinking how long will this take. Ha Ha, Your guess is as good as mine. Well, I am out. Take care everybody. </p>

				<p>Hi Everyone!</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t blogged since the PSO, so I have some updates to fill you in on.  Presently, we are continuing the project that we have been working on with the youth who attend the computer center, which is entitled &quot;Raising 100,000 Voices&quot;.  It is being sponsored by the community access station, WXXI-21( PBS affiliate) and the University of Rochester Medical Center (Mental Health Promotion).  The youth were given a digital camcorder, RCA Small Wonder to produce a 3 minute video.  (nice camcorder)  They are to use the music genre, Hip Hop, which is veiwed as a negative influence on youth in particular and produce a film that will show Hip Hop in a positive manner along with subject matter that also influence, impacts or are issues that youth deal with.  We have 11 youth involved and there are over 70 youth all together.  We have been meeting once a month to give and get encouragement, network, pointers,etc.  The youth are excited!</p>
<p>The finalists will be featured at the High Falls Film Festival, which takes place in Rochester during the summer and features independent films.  </p>
<p>Our computer center is also looking for technology sofware and curricula to help us recruit and work with  people who have disabilities who may want to come to the computer center. We have been talking to the people at the Center for Learning Disabilities and they have given us good feedback.  If anyone has any information on this subject please email me.  I was glad to see everyone was doing wonderful things at their sites!</p>
<p>Well until the next time, see ya!</p>
<p>Doreen</p>

	    <p>Hey Doreen,</p>
<p>Have you heard about CTCNet's C4All grants? <a href="http://ctcnet.org/what/initiatives/C4All/" title="http://ctcnet.org/what/initiatives/C4All/">http://ctcnet.org/what/initiatives/C4All/</a>  The Project is just forming a partnership with ATA too so we're hoping to have access to lots of accessibility resources for VISTAs very soon.</p>

				<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/171/421690115_852d4a487b_m.jpg" alt="Room Full of Storytellers (behind)" title="Room Full of Storytellers (behind)" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="240" height="148" align="left" />I just finished my first MassIMPACT Spreading the Stories three and 1/2 day digital storytelling train-the-trainer workshop, hosted graciously by <a href="http://www.iba-etc.org">Inquilinos Boricuas en Acción</a> (IBA) and the <a href="http://www.iba-etc.org/programs/villa_tech.html">El Batey Technology Center</a> of the Villa Victoria housing development in the South End of Boston.  It was the first of two workshops I&#39;m doing this spring in the South End, trying to foster some REALLY local working groups of digital storytelling facilitators.  I pitched the idea to David Kay of IBA and Giles Li of <a href="http://www.bcnc.net">Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center</a> (BCNC) after they both mentioned in separate meetings that they were interested in incorporating digital storytelling into their existing youth and adult programs.  As it turns out, they knew each other already and knew of some other interested community workers at the <a href="http://www.cstoboston.org/">Castle Square Technology Center</a>. I pulled in my fellow Mass Housing cohort, Seline, and a new friend Jayme from <a href="http://lnshhq05w.hud.gov/NN/contacts.nsf/WebCentByState/2BEF8F8FFA44D794852566210067CD52?OpenDocument">Mandela Residents Cooperative Association</a> and our group was complete.    </p>
<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/152/421689958_53b7df9ad1_m.jpg" alt="David, Seline, and Jayme Day 3" title="David, Seline, and Jayme Day 3" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="180" height="240" align="left" />We had a lively group of youth workers, adult education teachers, fundraisers, spoken word poets, administrators, and visual artists.  Every person had such a unique story, voice and approach that the finished set of stories ranged from a call for an end to the violence in the South End (and beyond), to a reflection on &quot;kneading&quot; your grandmother&#39;s coconut cake or diversity in one apartment building, to the cold nature of Bostonians, and finally to an immigrant teacher&#39;s love of &quot;civic navigation.&quot;  I heartfully enjoyed the subtle theme that emerged in many of the stories around turning challenges into blessings.    </p>
<p>We also brainstormed some ways that the three local South End programs can work with each other and share their existing knowledge bases and foster more collaboration among the organizations.  The youth workers were especially excited about bringing more meaningful use of technology into the youth&#39;s experiences and helping them break down the barriers by street corners and blocks that are leading to fights and escalating violence.    </p>
<p>I<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/156/421689798_812a759314_m.jpg" alt="Sheela helps Anna (Julio background)" title="Sheela helps Anna (Julio background)" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="180" height="240" align="right" /> was able to enlist the help of fellow facilitators Lisa and Sheela, which was more than necessary as we topped off the last day with TEN finished stories...well at least drafts! [They&#39;ll be up on the <a href="http://www.massimpact-ds.org/default.aspx">MassIMPACT website gallery</a> in the coming weeks, but here&#39;s a few photos up on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ctcvistaqueen/tags/iba/">Flickr</a> of the workshop itself.]  </p>
<p>The next workshop is in <strong>early May (1st, 8th &amp; 9th) at the BCNC</strong> and I&#39;m aiming to open it up to some local CTC VISTAs and others who are preparing for summer programs.  </p>

<p>      Andrea</p>
<p>      I am working with volunteer instructors to schedule regular monthly computer classes here at The Center. Classes are taught by volunteers and course topics reflect the interest and skills of the volunteer instructor. We have offered six classes in our first month and a half since we started, and already have a schedule lined up for the remainder of March and beginning of April. A challenge has been getting the word out about the classes so that attendance increases, although some classes, such as Introduction to Computers, are full!!</p>
<p>      The Center has also partnered with the Library of Congress and the Lambda Archives to participate in the Veteran's History Project. The project relies on volunteers to achieve its goal of collecting and preserving stories of wartime service. The (San Diego LGBT [Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender] Community) Center's is focusing on the stories and experiences of LGBT Veterans. We have completed 8 interviews thus far, and are training another group of volunteer interviews to conduct more Veteran interviews. We would then like as many LGBT Veterans as possible to take their interview and their pictures, and create a digital story!</p>

				<p>Wow, I haven&#39;t blogged since November.  </p>
<p>I&#39;ve been meaning to do it. Thinking about doing it. Feeling like I should do it. But now I&#39;m actually doing it. A nice quiet Friday afternoon presents the perfect time to blog.</p>
<p> So, what have I been up to? Planning workshops, teaching workshops, going to meetings, working on curriculum materials, and helping with a website project for digital storytelling facilitators.  That&#39;s the past few months in a nutshell.</p>
<p> To expand on a few aspects: </p>
<p>Workshops: I guess that teaching workshops begins to cross over into the &quot;direct service&quot; category, but workshops are the heart of what we do at Center for Digital Storytelling, so if I didn&#39;t participate in some of them I wouldn&#39;t be very helpful to the organization. Teaching in the workshops has shown me what stuff people consistently trip over in the software, which helps me know how to structure our new software guides. It also has shown me how much work is involved in putting on workshops, especially those customized for a specific group. There&#39;s literally months of email exchanges, meetings, logistics planning, and recruiting before the workshop takes place. Then there&#39;s three incredibly intense days of work, and maybe a week or so of tying up the loose ends. (More if the project involves special curriculum materials or a custom DVD)</p>
<p>Anyway, you all don&#39;t really care about all of that. What I think may be relevant is the point that I&#39;m sure all of you are observing on your own: nonprofits are hard work. It seems that there&#39;s never enough time, money, expertise, or staff to get everything done. Now I understand why CDS has tutorials that are probably 3 years old and full of typos. It&#39;s because just running the day-to-day operations of the organization takes so much work that there&#39;s not much energy left over for creating the tools that would actually make our work easier. I&#39;m still trying to figure out how to balance that. Example: If I take three hours of my day today, I can get one rough-draft tutorial fully edited, printed, and ready to use. That means I&#39;ll be three hours behind on everything else, but I won&#39;t have to scramble at the next workshop to print out a half-done tutorial (and neither will my coworkers.) If I take three days to get all of our lab computers in tip-top shape, we&#39;ll probably be set for the next couple months. But I&#39;ll  never have three free days because of meetings, phone calls, deadlines, etc.</p>
<p>To solve some of these problems, my very supportive supervisors suggested that I hire some volunteer interns to help with the more basic tasks so I could focus on the tutorials and other capacity building that requires some know-how. This seemed like a great idea, but now I&#39;ve spent a good chunk of time soliciting interns, interviewing candidates, and training the three that I selected. And the one day a week that they are here, I get less done because they have a lot of questions. I&#39;m hoping that this is because they are new, and as they get more experienced they will be more self-sufficient.</p>
<p>So, to sum up, I&#39;m feeling a bit overworked. I think I need to start a yoga class or something to destress a bit. The good news is I&#39;m learning lots, even if sometimes I&#39;m learning it the hard way. </p>

	    <p>Hi Jessica,</p>
<p> That does sound a bit stressful, but you sound like you&#39;re handling it quite well! That&#39;s pretty nifty you get your own interns and three at that! You should  definitely take a Yoga class or something of that nature. Laura and I have a few favorite weekly TV shows that give us something stress-free to look forward to. Do you have a bike you can ride around or a favorite coffee shop? Anyway, keep up the good work, it&#39;s good to hear your blog-voice again! :)</p>
