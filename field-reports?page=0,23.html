				<p>It&#39;s recently come to my attention that I have disappeared from the face of the vista planet. So I have a small update.</p>
<p>Since March, this is what I have been doing at BNN:</p>
<p>- Taking inventory on new equipment</p>
<p>- Going and presenting our summer teen program at summer opprotunities fairs</p>
<p>- Learning how to use the new equipment</p>
<p>- Editing a BNN program called &quot;Early Works&quot; which is a compliation show of footage from recently trained producers</p>
<p>- Helping set up logistics for our summer program (how many teens, how many groups, how many supervisors)</p>
<p>- Mailing out applications</p>
<p>- Recieving applications back</p>
<p>- Setting up and updating spreadsheets on everyone we sent applications to and ones we&#39;ve recieved back</p>
<p>- Updating BNN&#39;s Community Bulletin Board</p>
<p>- Helping with various mailouts BNN has because I&#39;m apparently a mailout-machiiiiiiine.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Instead of being at the Multimedia center in Roxbury everyday, I&#39;m now there four days a week, and spend one day a week at the cityplace location, mainly for updating the community bulletin board and collecting applications.</p>

				<p>I don't know if you are facing a problem similar to the one I am attempting to confront. For many months, the central problem I have been attempting to address is that the organization I work for is underdeveloped. When I started at CUWiN, there was no Board of Directors, no real decision-making process, and no structures for accountability. We didn't even have an accurate accounting of our own books.</p>
<p>Since September, I have been working to address these problems with varying levels of success. While I won't go into the details of how CUWiN has gone about its organizational development here, I will note that it has been a process fraught with peril. Part of this is because I am completely willing to be confrontational, which some people simply can't handle (especially if they have ego-maniacal tendencies). However, the biggest part of the problem has been my foolish attempt to reinvent the wheel. I have been approaching organizational development as if one can get things together simply by reasoned argument. I still believe strongly in reason, but I am now aware of two things which are reasons to change my tactics: a) many, many people are unreasonable, especially when their relationships to other people are at stake; and b) there is a vast literature available from really smart people about how to develop an organization. </p>
<p>Given these new facts, I am altering my approach to addressing the challenges that I am confronting in my day-to-day work. I am embarking on a journey to educate myself about how to develop organizations and to organize that knowledge in my blogging. I am also inviting anyone who is interested in joining me. I believe that there are many people who are probably facing similar organizational challenges who will benefit from this work.</p>
<p>And yes, I'm calling it work because it is work.It is, in many ways, the most essential work that I can do at this time. To me, the stakes are the development or death of the organization. I don't believe the organization can survive the stagnation that has persisted for more than a year. I also believe that the organization has a lot to offer the community in which I live and the world at large.</p>
<h3>My Strategy</h3>
<p>I am starting with the following website: <a href="http://foundationcenter.org/">http://foundationcenter.org/</a>. Having glanced through it, I have found many of the thoughts to be quite useful. I am going to the library this afternoon to locate some of the resources that are there. I will report the resource I find on the <a href="wiki.html">wiki</a>, but I will comment on those resources in this blog. In this way, I hope to begin a resource center for VISTAs who are face similar challenges.</p>
<p>If you wish to engage this journey, you can do so in many ways beyond simply reading this blog. If you want to help review materials, I certainly welcome that. If there are things that you are already reading/reviewing/using, let me know and I will search for other materials, that way we can maximize our coverage. If you want to help review materials but have no idea how to get started, please let me know and I will point you to materials that need to be covered. Finally, if you don't really want to get involved but you have references or ideas, please share them with me. I'm hungry for new sources of information.</p>

	    <p>Hey Ross,</p>
<p>Kevin Palmer, the current VISTA at HOME Inc and future VISTA Leader at UMB, had done a lot of research this year on organizational development and strategic planning.  </p>
<p>We had a great consultant last year, Jillaine Smith, who does TANP stuff but also does a lot of organizational development stuff as well.  Her blog is <a href="http://jillaine.blogspot.com/" title="http://jillaine.blogspot.com/">http://jillaine.blogspot.com/</a> but I'm sure if you emailed her, she'd send you lots of info.</p>
<p>I also know that Lauren B. at Media Bridges in OH is asking similar questions about strategic planning.  </p>
<p>And maybe you could put what info you gather on the CTC VISTA Wiki?</p>

				<p>So I have finished 1/3rd of my year as a Vista. When I started I was very ambitious ready to sink my teeth into the community and my organization. I was on the brink of a new life and I did not know what to expect. I went to Boston and completed my PSO. I returned to Minneapolis and showed up to my organization on the next Monday. I could not guess what my first day was going to be, who I would meet. So I walk in and say hello to Michael the program supervisor here at PCTV and my mentor and partner. I was ready to pounce at any task he would give me. After I set down my bag and removed about six layers of clothing (This is Minneapolis in January, and I ride a bicycle every year all year; it&#39;s not so bad it just takes some preparation and determination) we got started. What happened, what was the beginning of it all. This is what Michael said &quot;Well we should probably get you some keys for the building and all&quot;. That is what I had been waiting for, it was sort of a shock to me at first. Then is when I realized that Vista life wasn&#39;t going to be a superhero action movie, it was going to be regular life, with a more positive and rewarding purpose. </p>
<p>So the first day passed, I got my keys, met the staff and the after school youth and got my desk in order. At this point I had no idea what was next. What was I suppose to do. The next few weeks were filled with learning Acronyms that I still don&#39;t know the meanings of and trying to remember who is connected to which one. I had a meeting with the staff and we started talking about what it was that I was going to be doing at PCTV over the course of the year and when I should be doing it. I started researching, ideating and thinking a lot.  It&#39;s been four months. I have planned out two new websites, started an after school graphic design workshop, and mostly just gotten adjusted to working in the non-profit world.</p>

	    <p>I remember my first 'real' job out of college was working at a food bank. One of the most meaningful days I had was when the food bank director handed me the keys to the food bank - this is where the food to feed our whole community was held.  Food that helped so many impoverished people get better (or at least get by).  An equally moving day was giving those keys back when my term ended...</p>

				<p>As part of the website redesign, we&#39;re adding new sections for user generated content.  We needed to keep this content separate from the rest of the site, so that any user could edit the user sections, but not the rest of the site.  For basic content types, this is simply a matter of defining a new content type based on the standard drupal &quot;node&quot;, and then assigning the correct permissions to that new type.  But what if you want to do something similar to a more advanced content-type such as a book?  One could extend the book module to support a similar derived content feature (best solution).  But that can take a fair amount of time, and with no guarantee of changes being accepted upstream, you face the possibility of either running outdated module code, or having to reapply your edits for every update.  A quicker, and much simpler method, especially for those with little programming experience, is to make a few, essentially cosmetic changes to the book module.  These changes consist primarily of changed the names of the tables the module stores its data in, and the internal name that drupal uses to identify the module and its components.  And while your modifying, you can easily alter the human-readable names and descriptions.  And its all as easy as Find &amp; Replace.   </p>
<p>The Easy Way: </p>
<p>One should make a backup copy of the books module.  I would suggest creating a new directory, name it after the short, drupal id form of the content type, and place the files from the book module in this directory.  Renaming them would be a good idea too.  Then do the following in all of those files. </p>
<p>One could easily do a &quot;Replace all&quot; on &quot;book&quot; and &quot;Book&quot; with the words/identifiers you desire.  Caveats:  the word replacing book cannot have spaces, and should not have other odd characters; not starting with a number would be advisable as well.  A short word or acronym or other identifier would be preferred here.  The reason for this is that in some places &quot;book&quot; is being used as an identifier by Drupal, and so we must make sure that what we use will not cause the PHP or SQL to break.  In our case, we replaced it with &quot;cnrc&quot;, since this new book will be used to provide books and book pages for the Community Networking Resource Center area of the new website.  &quot;Book&quot; is used only in description and such, and is not used internally by Drupal.  As such, we can replace it with whatever we want.  Just be careful of including quotation marks, either single or double, as they could be misinterpreted by PHP.  In our case we replaced it with the expanded acronym.  The plural of &quot;book&quot; and &quot;Book&quot; are sometimes used as well.  The process described above will replace the appropriate portions of these words, thus leaving the replacements with an &quot;s&quot; suffix.  If this is undesirable, use either a &quot;match only whole word&quot; feature, or replace the plural forms first. </p>
<p>Whats Really Going On:</p>
<p> The .info file included with module contains the data that is displayed in the &quot;Modules&quot; section of the admin screens.  Its not important to change it, but doing so will make your life (or however assumes job of maintaining the site&#39;s life) a lot easier.   The fields here can contain pretty much any value.</p>
<p>The .install file contains the code responsible for installing and uninstalling the module.  Its what makes the correct tables in the database, for instance.  To truly keep the data from the various &quot;book&quot; modules separate, we need to make our module use a different table.  The requires editing the sql queries encapsulated in the PHP.  I also suggest renaming the function as well.  Not only does it improve clarity, it prevents naming collisions.  Drupal, at least as far as I&#39;ve seen, runs in one big namespace.  Hence, all modules must provide unique function names.  The convention is to prefix the functions with the modules short (internal drupal) name.</p>
<p> The .module file contains all the internal workings of the module.  The same thing about function names applies here as in the .install file.  the *_node_info function contains the base parameters (drupal name,verbose name, and description).  The variables whose values are wrapped in t(&#39; &#39;) will accept Unicode characters.  the &quot;module&quot; variable will not.  In here the paths and such are defined as well.  The find &amp; replace method will modify these as well, thus allowing one to customize the url locations.</p>
<p>Motivation and Alternatives:</p>
<p>The redesign of the site presented us with a case wherein we might have books that only staff should be able to edit, and other books that should be open to the general public.  With the current book module, that is not possible.  I suspect one may be able to achieve similar functionality with the CCk for Drupal 5, however, I haven&#39;t had time to explore it yet.  Given my programming background, I found modifying the module much simpler than learning the quirks of a Drupal interface.  </p>

				<p>I taught my first class last week and it went great! I usually just teach the Internet section of the class but this time I taught the whole thing. Our classes at <a href="http://otxwest.org/" target="_blank">OTX-West</a> are 3 hours long and we teach basic computer training, Internet, and the OpenOffice programs Writer (similar to Word) and Impress (similar to PowerPoint). It was fun and the students and parents enjoyed it as well. I received great evaluations from them on my performance so that&#39;s cool.  </p>
<p>I also went to a 3 day digital storytelling workshop at the <a href="http://www.storycenter.org/" target="_blank">Center for Digital Storytelling</a> in Berkeley a few weeks back. I created my first digital story and it  was fun. I went with my coworker Domingo to get some pointers on how to do these classes. Jessica, the VISTA at CDS, invited us to attend. My story was good but I ran out of time and didn&#39;t get to do everything that I wanted.  I am editing my story on my own since I have all the files and I am even going to try to create the same story using Flash (which is going to be challenging since still learning the software) and OpenOffice Impress. It was a great experience and I want to thank Jessica and the Center for Digital Storytelling for having us. :)</p>
<p> Later,</p>

				<p class="MsoNormal">The digital divide issue is currently characterized by two distinct trains of thought: the digital binary group who choose to characterize the issue as there being a rift between the technological haves and have nots, and the digital inequity group who choose to characterize the issue as an uneven diffusion of participation, use, and skill in computers and the internet. The digital binary group believes that the gap between the ICT haves and have nots exists or has existed in the past, and bridging the gap is necessary to minimize the disadvantages of the unconnected. The digital inequity group acknowledges that not having adequate access to technology can harm your ultimate life chances, however they believe that merely owning technological gadgets alone will not address the greater problem of social inequity.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>The digital binary group was the first to respond to the issue. Formed when the internet was just becoming popularized, the digital binary group, armed with census data, aimed to demonstrate the uneven distribution of the information superhighway among Americans. They focus on ownership and access to technology as it relates to different classes in society, and they have demonstrated how some groups in America are under-equipped with computers and internet access. As the numbers of individuals who own computers grows every year, prices of computers fall, and product quality improves, progress towards bridging the digital divide is thought to be made. Some in the digital binary group believe the gap has been closed due to market forces making it much cheaper to own higher quality gadgets and high-speed connections. Others believe the gap persists as minorities, the poor, and the disabled remain unconnected at lower rates than the more advantaged white majority.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>The digital inequity group is the new comer to the issue. Although still concerned about ownership and access to the internet and computers, the digital inequity group sees beyond mere ownership of gadgets. They feel that technology is embedded in pre-existing social structures and systems, and that failing to participate in technology is akin to removing yourself from the benefits these social constructs provide. The digital equity group places a high value on social inclusion as they believe ICT allows citizens to completely participate in society, have adequate levels of control over their own lives, and maximizes the economic, health, educational, and cultural benefits available to them through the internet. Finally, the digital inequity group believes that the digital binary group oversimplifies the issue as they fail to take into account differences in levels of participation, computer skills, and purpose of use in their analysis of ICT distribution, and that they, either intentionally or unintentionally, demean those unconnected to ICT by claiming they are doomed to a life of labor-intensive, low-pay work if they do not pay into the almighty church of technology consumption.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>With these two groups in mind, the digital divide issue becomes complex, contentious, and debatable. Both camps have had their redeeming factors and usefulness for their respective eras in internet history; however, as more and more people in the United States log on to the World Wide Web, the digital binary group loses some of its connection to reality and helpfulness to the disadvantaged. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>To begin with, computer ownership and access to the web are only superficial indicators of social benefits. Owning a computer with internet access does not mean that person will use it to empower themselves, participate in the community, or improve their lives. Access, whether it is access to a computer, the web, or computer literacy, can not ensure that individuals, especially disadvantaged individuals, will derive any benefit from ICT. Computer ownership may mean that those owners have more and better internet experiences from the privacy of their own home; however, it is not an absolute indication of computer skills and purpose of use.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Secondly, assuming that the technological have nots are destined for doom without an internet connection and computer at home is inaccurate and demeaning. Plenty of people choose to not connect to the internet and have rich, fulfilling lives. Warren Buffett, perhaps the world’s greatest investor and philanthropist, does not have a computer in his home nor does he carry a cell phone. Technology may carry significant social, economic, and political advantages, but it does not determine success, happiness, or fulfillment. By applying pressure to have the disadvantaged sign up for the internet and purchase computers, the digital binary group imposes a set of values on a plural, differentiated group, thereby proselytizing and coercing them to comply with a hegemonic dictum of information and communication privileging.<span>  </span>Technology improves lives, but only when people are given the option. The digital inequity group asks that everyone should have a fair chance to access ICT without demeaning those who choose not to access it.<span>         </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Third, the digital binary group suffers from a lack of information. Indeed, the only reason the digital binary group characterized the digital divide as a divide between the digital haves and have nots in the first place is due to a lack of data. Census data during the 1990s, especially the early 1990s, did not offer information on how much individuals used their computers, what they used them for, how they had bettered themselves through technology, etc. Recent studies have demonstrated that mere ownership of technology is inadequate when addressing ICT diffusion. Therefore, it has become clear that increasing computer and internet penetration rates should not be the only action taken to solve the problem, and that a mixed bag of solutions should take the fore when focusing on improving technological diffusion.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>The digital inequity group believes that social inclusion, computer skills, and purpose of use take precedence over mere ownership of technological gadgets. They believe that greater social inclusion leads to empowerment and belonging; better computer skills lead to greater employability and social involvement; and well-directed purpose of use leads to life-improvements and quality of life gains. They believe that full technological diffusion will be achieved when all members of society master the general maneuverability of ICT, not when all members of society own a device. When turning on a computer, searching for content on the web, and fully utilizing software programs become skills that everyone can perform is when we can speak of a truly closed digital divide. </p>

	    <p> interesting post.  </p>
<p> it is easy for warren buffett not to use a computer because he already made his name in a time when not using a computer was normal. i would imagine that for people starting out today, those that don&#39;t use computers will have a harder time of things simply because so many others do use computers and that is what is expected. i&#39;m not saying this is how it should be but how i think it is. do you have any evidence (even anecdotal) to refute or confirm this perception? </p>

	    <p>Making money in business or running a successful non-profit is determined by the organization&#39;s capacity for innovation (see Drucker, Peter). Right now, there has been so much innovation in the digital technology world that computers seems to be synonymous with innovation and invention. But there are plenty of other ways to be innovative that doesnt include digital technology.</p>
<p>As for quality of life and digital technology, I believe self-fulfillment is determined by the individual and not their gadgets.  I believe the internet can and does empower folks, but the individual has to first want to be empowered. If folks want a better life, its up to them to decide what that better life looks like and if its worth striving for. I dont see how digital technology plays a part in that process other than helping folks achieve their goals once they&#39;ve been set.</p>
<p>For me, the biggest problem with the under-served or the disadvantaged is that they dont have goals, they have little sense of self-worth, they are fragile, and they are incompetent.  Technology isnt going to help them. If anything, its just going to add to the long list of things they arent good at. These folks need training, rehabilitation, and community involvement. All of which can be made better by technology, but its a very very very very very very fine line that everyone everywhere seems to miss. Its not the technology that should be emphasized, but the health and human services and the social programming. </p>

	    <p>I disagree with the idea that technology does little to help folks achieve their goals.  And personally, I find some of the statements in your last reply offensive.  You say that the &quot;under-served or the disadvantaged...dont have goals...have little sense of self-worth... are fragile, and...are incompetent.&quot;  If VISTAs are carrying around these outrageous and stereotypical ideas about low-income folks, what are we really achieving as VISTAS anyway?  I work with many so called &#39;incompetent, goal-less&#39; low-income and/or homeless families at the Homeless Prenatal that use technology to find jobs to support their families, look for public housing, research their pregnancies and build and advertise for their own businesses.  </p>
<p>Most of these families have many goals and desires and the HPP acts as a tool for many families to achieve these goals.  Additionally, our technology center helps people (that have been  told so often they were not good enough, smart enough, determined enough) learn how to use these tools as access points for many social services.   We try to help our clients realize their enormous capacity through technology education.  Our classes aim to not only teach technology, but to use technology as a self-sufficiency builder to help people accomplish their goals.  </p>

	    <p>Im sorry if I offended you or anybody, but I still think it is true that the underprivileged suffer from low self-esteem and related problems. Im not going to sugar coat it, and I dont believe Im being stereotypical because I live in a poor neighborhood and I see it. Poor folks dont feel good about themselves.</p>
<p>The CTCs that Ive worked with do a good job. But, Id like to see more types of services integrated with them. Things like substance abuse prevention, parenting classes, and invigorating after-school programs.  I dont think a CTC is going to succeed if it assumes its users are all hunky-dory, well-adjusted folks. They have to know their community and be able to objectively address their community issues.</p>
<p> Im not saying that poor folks are bad people, but a lot are troubled and in need of more help than just knowing how to use a computer. Yeah, computer training can make someone feel more confident in themselves, but its not enough to just teach them a skill. They need more support, and I think a more comprehensive service packaging will go a long ways towards achieving a more equitable society. </p>

				<p>I&#39;m just recovering from April 2007, which will forever be known in my mind as &quot;the month of excessive conferences.&quot;  It started with <a href="node/697.html" target="_blank">WAM</a>!, then <a href="node/704.html" target="_blank">NTEN</a> in DC. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.bgcbcybersummit.org/img/logo.jpg" alt="BGCB Cyber Summit 07 Logo" title="BGCB Cyber Summit 07 Logo" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="143" height="89" align="right" /> But then a couple weeks ago I stole Ben from Project HQ and we headed over to the newly renovated Yawkey Boys &amp; Girls Club in Roxbury for the <a href="http://www.bgcbcybersummit.org/">7th annual Boys &amp; Girls Club of Boston Cyber Summit</a>.  We did some digital storytelling and Google Mapping with 5 youth from Roxbury and Dorchester.  The youth did great, taking lots of great photos outside the Club around Dudley but we struggled a bit with technical aspects of embedding videos in the new Google My Maps functionality.   </p>
<div><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=101445738256769772921.0000011206202fb7ca2a9&amp;hl=en&amp;z=18&amp;ll=42.330131,-71.083721&amp;spn=0.001844,0.003616&amp;t=k&amp;om=1" target="_blank"><img src="http://digitalartscorps.org/files/user4/storymap.jpg" alt="" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="161" height="156" align="left" /></a></div>
<p>You can check out the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=101445738256769772921.0000011206202fb7ca2a9&amp;hl=en&amp;z=18&amp;ll=42.330131,-71.083721&amp;spn=0.001844,0.003616&amp;t=k&amp;om=1">map</a> but it keeps erasing the embed code so most of the videos won&#39;t play! We made DVDs and also put the <a href="http://cybersummit2007.blip.tv/">videos on Blip.tv</a>.</p>
<p>I also recruited former CTC VISTA Saul Baizman to do some web design, tag teaming with my pal Hope Roth who now works at Tufts University.  </p>
<p>I enjoyed supporting my old co-workers and this great Club event.  The projects the youth create in two short days (including one night of sleep-over that doesn&#39;t involve much sleep) always impresses me. </p>

<p>I also got to see some VISTAs - my girl Shaneka from WYTEC presented and hosted with grace and I snuck Laura Mieczkowski in for free lunch so I could hear about her new outreach project with CTCNet Chicago. The crew of managers from the Boston Clubhouses were all still exhausted from Cyber Summit too, but it good to see all the old and new faces gathered to contemplate the next steps of the Clubhouse network. </p>

<p>I documented my tourist wanderings and impressions on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ctcvistaqueen/tags/chicago/">Flickr</a>.   Overall, it was a good ending to an exhausting month of networking. </p>
<p> May looks lighter, both in work and weather, with facilitating just one adult digital storytelling train-the-trainer at the <a href="http://www.bcnc.net">Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center</a> and helping out with a series of Saturday trainings with youth at the South End Technology Center.  Oh and working hard on user testing for the new online community site (StoriesForChange.net) I&#39;m project managing for MassIMPACT for community digital storytellers (due to soft launch at the end of May).  Oh and recruiting and matching up some new VISTAs for the June round and planning the next PSO, that&#39;s at the Grassroots Use of Technology Conference in Lowell, MA.   </p>
<p> Wait...that&#39;s not adding up to &quot;lighter&quot;...is it? </p>

				<p>This is the first week in many months that I do not have any outreaches. I had two of them to focus on for the past several months.  One was from a high school and the other was an after school program.</p>
<p> The high school group was a bit difficult.  Most the kids were there by default, since the options they wanted were already full.  But it ended up ok.  I will say I tried to use a curriculum and that miserably failed.    It partly happened that way since half the kids were already familiar with video production and some imovie (though they failed to tell me that during our first day, no wonder why they were not paying attention).  It also may have happened because another portion of the group was completely uninterested in learning.  Some of these kids have issues with instant gratification.  They want results now.  There was little interest in planning.  And then when it came time to shoot, there was no planning to fall back on.  I also hate to say this, but it was kinda a rotten group of kids.  A couple of loud mouths and show offs detract from the rest of the group and impede on learning.  But I guess that&#39;s a common complaint.  One of the students even voiced her distaste for the class and completely disrespected the teacher.   She called the teacher lazy and annoying and all these things right to her face.  Maybe kids these days have little respect and little patience.  </p>
<p> For one kid, all he wanted to do was hustle and make rap and beats and all that junk.  I finanlly gave in, since he was not productive to the group, and let him play with garageband.  I explained the program to him, gave him a tutorial.  Even set him up.  And he couldn&#39;t even figure it out.  All he wanted to do was make beats.  And we have that capacity.  But he wanted it instantly-  he sat at the computer for nearly two hours with nothing to show.  geez. </p>
<p> Anyways, they did have some final results.  There was a psa about basketball and physical activity.  And there were grandios plans for a motorcycle fundraiser where motorcycle groups in the area would preform tricks and stuff.  That fundraiser was cancelled.  But at least there were two good interviews about motorcycles and safety and some other issues that were turned into a short movie.  Nothing festival worthy, but I&#39;m sure glad that they at least produced something.  I also had some good talks about consumerism and why those nike air forces and michael jordans are so important.  Puts the whole media literacy in perspective when trying to teach it to a bunch of urban youth who work hard at crappy jobs to earn the money to get the shoes and the looks to be socially accepted.  </p>
<p> The other group at the after-school center turned out well, despite a few obstacles.  The kids were making a video about their center to show parents at a community brunch.  They got great footage and interviews.  BUT lo and behold, one of the cameras I was using was freakin broken.  And I had no idea until it was editing time because I never went over the footage.  I guess the heads on the camera were misaligned resulting in digital glitches in the video and the sound.  Also, one of the mics was malfunctioning.   </p>
<p>LESSON:  always go back and look at your footage.  Ideally, import it into a computer.  </p>
<p> In the end, it worked out ok.   Kids got to use a camera, which most of them never have before.  But there was little time for editing, which was what some the kids were really excited about.  I think some of those kids are signing up for our summer classes too, so that was a good way to get more kids involved.   </p>
<p> The next month will be spent fixing some other videos, preparing for summer classes, and working on the policies and guidelines for the youth media program here </p>

				<p>Sitting next to Peter and gazing out at the Washington Monument, I realized that there weren&#39;t too many better ways to end my VISTA service than flying up the Potomac.  Just an hour earlier, I had been in a scowling mood, but the D. C. evening skyline changed that pretty quickly.</p>
<p>For those who weren&#39;t there, the NTEN (Non-profit Technology Network) Conference was a smashing success.  People from both sides of the Atlantic came to Washington to sip beer, talk tech, and figure out how to use technology to benefit society.  I was fortunate enough to meet people from California, Illinois, New York, Manchester, London, and D. C. itself.  Washington had splendid weather, and the cherry blossoms were in bloom.</p>
<p>Everyone showed up in Washington on Tuesday, April 3rd and had the day to themselves.  We of the CSL persuasion flew into Washington, but got a bit lost on the way to the hotel.  We had a rough idea of where we were going on the Metro, but weren&#39;t sure at which stop to leave.  I ended up calling my mom to find out.  Thank goodness for cell phones!  And after we got off, we still walked three or four blocks in the wrong direction!  Remember, folks: water runs <em>downhill.</em> </p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how the Project decided on dinner, but they had found an Indian restaurant within walking distance of the hotel and made reservations for that Tuesday night.  We walked over, chatted for a bit, then lined up family-style and plunged in.</p>
<p>I woke up the next morning to a two-dollar bottle of Coke and a two-dollar muffin.  Hotels, like airports, seem to operate on an economy of convenience: it&#39;s convenient for you not to leave the hotel, so it&#39;s convenient for the hotel to charge you $2 for your morning fix.  If only everything in the hotel were $2....</p>
<p> Wednesday&#39;s conference sessions went pretty well.  There was a CTC VISTA meeting in the afternoon, and the morning brought a good open-source development seminar.  The afternoon Science Fair was crazy--people stood behind tables in the hotel ballroom, hawking their wares and explaining what their companies offer.  The Project was kind enough to lend us space at their table, so the CSL got a good chance to show what it does.   The table&#39;s location was splendid: right next to the complimentary fajitas.</p>
<p>Mmmm.  Complimentary fajitas.  Free chocolate-covered macadamia nuts.  Not reasons unto themselves to come to a conference, but they were pretty nice after running on a coke and a muffin all day.  Cokes were $4, however!  In terms of tech freebies, the NTEN folks gave everyone a free USB pen drive (256 MB), and another organization was giving out free retractable Ethernet cables.  Special mention, however, must go to the Wilderness Technology Alliance and their Xeon processors.  We can find a good home for them--thank you!</p>
<p>I&#39;m realizing that I&#39;ve given very few words here to actual technology, and given quite a bit of space to the conference goings-on.  Most of the 4-5 conferences I&#39;ve attended over the last couple of years have been this way--as much as they&#39;ve been about technology, an equal focus has been on socializing and networking.  The conferences have been a chance to meet people, to eat good food, and to learn a little bit.  The NTEN conference, being in Washington, was also a chance to explore a new (for me) city.</p>
<p>After hitting a jazz jam session downtown (learned some new lyrics to &quot;Song for My Father&quot;), I found a 24-hour bookstore/cafe in Dupont Circle.  I learned that Washington&#39;s subways move faster than Boston&#39;s, and that you&#39;d better know whether you&#39;re on <em>West </em>D Street or <em>East </em>D Street.  Also, seeing a long line to your museum of choice (Air and Space) doesn&#39;t mean you have to stand in it.  There may be another entrance! </p>
<p>On Thursday (the 5th), I jumped into a &quot;Linux Laptop&quot; session.  What fun!  Even though I didn&#39;t bring my laptop (running Debian Etch) with me, I helped two fellows learn their way around the latest version of Ubuntu Linux.  I must say that for non-programmers, the usability gap between Ubuntu and Windows is getting smaller.  If you&#39;re a programmer in anything except .NET or ASP, Ubuntu&#39;s far superior.</p>
<p>Thursday also marks the first occasion that I&#39;ve been kicked out of a room party and slept with four other guys in the same hotel room (hostels don&#39;t count).  The NTEN folks were also nice enough to let all the VISTAs into their Thursday night Salsa party, where we had a good time acting silly and learning how to dance--the cha-cha-cha.</p>
<p>So Friday--and with apologies to The Cure, I was in love with Washington.  The lack of sleep hit me sometime Friday afternoon, but when Peter showed up as a last-minute passenger on our flight back to Boston, talking up a happy storm, and I saw the Capitol illuminated against the nighttime sky, post-VISTA life was pretty darned good. </p>

				<p>Okay so I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all experienced this...being nervous. In less then two weeks I&#39;m beginning my first after-school program. At two of the local middle schools I will be teaching students how to conduct oral histories. This is a kind of pilot to see if the program will occur next fall...HOPEFULLY it does. I&#39;m looking forward to working with the kids but still trying to figure out everything I need. So if anyone has an tips for the first day let me know.</p>
<p>Take care all.</p>

	    <p>I've got lots of stuff around doing storytelling with youth that might help....and I'd definitely be interested in any oral history stuff you develop or dig up.  </p>
<p>Ever heard of StoryCorps?  They have a spot on NPR public radio and they do these mobile labs where they get people in pairs to interview each other.  They have a pretty cool online tool for setting up interview questions - <a href="http://www.storycorps.net/participate/question_generator/" title="http://www.storycorps.net/participate/question_generator/">http://www.storycorps.net/participate/question_generator/</a> and a toolkit for doing audio interviews - <a href="http://www.storycorps.net/participate/do-it-yourself_guide/" title="http://www.storycorps.net/participate/do-it-yourself_guide/">http://www.storycorps.net/participate/do-it-yourself_guide/</a>.</p>

				<p>Working with Ross on a massive website redesign.  This redesign is brought on partially from complaints of website users about the disparate nature of the content, and the difficulty in finding relevant information on the site.  A recent hard drive failure on our web host&#39;s server which resulted in some loss of content was also a contributing factor.  We hope to have something up next week.  The site will actually be broken into multiple sites to allow for better organization.  Drupal will power two of the sites--the CUWiN main site, and a second specifically for the local network.  Two additional sites will be created using wiki software.  One will be a private wiki to document the organizations infrastructure and to store other private documents.  The second will be a wiki for the developers.  It will focus on bug tracking, software documentation, etc.  I&#39;m considering using Ikiwiki (<a href="http://www.ikiwiki.info" title="www.ikiwiki.info">www.ikiwiki.info</a>) for this, as it is simple, and integrates with the code repository.  Hopefully this will make it easier developers to incorporate the wiki (and documentation) into their work flow.</p>

				<p>Well there was a lot of deliberation about me going to a conference around here. But finally it was decided that I would be going to the<a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.ourchannels.org/?p=40" title="Permanent Link to ACM 2007 International Conference &amp; Trade Show"> ACM 2007 International Conference &amp; Trade Show</a>. </p>
<p>But things have changed. And it&#39;s all thanks to that lovely bit of legistlation that SBC/AT&amp;T pushed down Michigan&#39;s throat a few months back.</p>
<p> While Comcast did agree to maintain it&#39;s contract with the CMC, they also took advantage of the loop hole in under the new laws which allows them to change the payment schedule. So the francise fees (over $150,000) that the CMC usually gets in April will not be coming until August. Thus all expenitures must be cut back to the bone.</p>
<p>So, I will not be attending the ACM conference. Nor will anyone at the Media Center be doing so including Laurie, our director, who was scheduled to speak there.</p>
<p>That&#39;s the way the Public Access cookie crumbles.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to be presenting the Media Center with any new program ideas. Not unless my idea is a money maker. And charging for services would kind of defeat the point. *shrug*</p>
<p>It&#39;s a tough time to be in this business.</p>
<p>I hope everyone is doing well. </p>
<p>Later,</p>
<p>Rich </p>

<p>That major stinks! I definitely feel the pain as we tried to outreach to public access stations to get VISTAs and they just can't do it.  And I also know quite a few folks trying to convice PEG access stations to do more stuff digitally and they just can't imagine it.  I actually sat in at a conference at MIT a few months ago where someone (a person NOT from the public access world) suggested that public access stations should accept their fate and come up with an "exit strategy" of moving to all online endeavors.  It's a really hard fight to talk to folks about too - I mean, many people see public access as a bunch of Wayne's World like content that they don't care about.  </p>

				<p>Have you ever done something quick and dirty even though doing things &quot;the right way&quot; would only take a little more time? Maybe you didn&#39;t have a little more time? Of course. Haven&#39;t we all?</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example. Recently, I was creating a conference registration form for a client on her Plone-based site. Ideally, the client would have created and maintained the registration form herself, since the tool we were using has a graphical form creation interface. However, the documentation for the tool we were using was out of date. I thought about updating the documentation at that time and then helping the client through it, but that would have required a lot more time than just setting up the form myself. Also, I was going to be out of town shortly (for the NTEN conference) and the client wanted to start accepting conference registrations as soon as possible. In the circumstances, it seemed a reasonable solution for me to create the form, so I did. Many form tweaks later, I think I have spent more time on updating the form than it would have taken to update the documentation, which could have helped others besides just this client.</p>
<p>I think many things in life are like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle">sliding puzzles</a> -- you may have to suffer temporary &quot;setbacks&quot; (moving blocks out of the correct positions) in order to get the optimal end result. Maybe the trick is not to think of them as setbacks but as steps toward a goal. I have started trying to be very conscious of how I do things. If it will make things better or more efficient in the future, I want to choose to spend more time up front for foundational work. It is challenging to try to work according to a long term vision rather than according to what seems most pressing at the moment. </p>
<p>One challenge is when your organization as a whole doesn&#39;t really support it. (Do any?) Here&#39;s what I have noticed often happens when employees want to work on improving their organization in big picture ways:<br />
<table border="0">
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td><em>Employee</em> - Hey, I was thinking that we should have a system for organizing our files so everyone can access them easily instead of having them scattered in disarray on our server and our website and old emails. <br /><em>Boss</em> - That would be great. You should set that up.<br /><em>Employee</em> - Will I be able to spend a little time away from my current projects to do it?<br /><em>Boss</em> - You know how important our work is -- we just can&#39;t afford to take time away from it.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p><p>And the boss has to think about things like if grantmakers will be ok with his/her organization having less immediate results because the organization was focusing on long-term effectiveness. (Also, it may be particularly difficult for nonprofits to take &quot;time out&quot; to become more efficient because if they&#39;re not spending all their effort heads-down on mission work children will starve or trees will get cut down or... But what about the children etc you aren&#39;t getting to help because your organization is not efficient enough?)</p>
<p>Or perhaps acting with the big picture in mind doesn&#39;t lead to greater productivity and less stress as I imagine it would, because of the increased effort/costs required. What do you think? Is your organization shortsighted (not that you need to have a simple yes/no answer)? How does this impact the work that you do?</p>

	    <p> Yeah, we have that same issue. We&#39;re so busy just keeping up with our everyday tasks that we don&#39;t take time to create patterns that would improve our workflow. It&#39;s a tough problem. I keep thinking that things will slow down a little bit, enough that I can take time to work on long-term stuff, but then things always pop up last minute. </p>
<p> Sorry, I don&#39;t have any ideas either about how to solve it...I&#39;ve been trying to get more volunteers and interns to help with some of the more mundane tasks here to free up time for other things, but that just means I have to spend time supervising them. So it&#39;s not perfect.</p>
<p> Good Luck! </p>

				<p>Hello everyone! Time for an update. I&#39;ve been way way busy lately (I&#39;m sure you all know how that feels). We just finished a weeklong workshop with middle schoolers at the <a href="http://www.themyc.org/">Marin Youth Center&#39;s</a> Computer <a href="http://www.iccsrafael.org/">Clubhouse</a>. It was my first time in a computer clubhouse, they seem like a great idea! While I was there I learned a little about making beats using <a href="http://www.fruityloops.com/documents/146.html" target="_blank">FruityLoops</a>. Fun! But a lot harder than I thought it would be.  </p>
<p>Right now the main things on my plate are working with Danielle and others on Stories for Change, a web portal for community-based digital storytelling facilitators. Danielle is head of the committee that&#39;s creating the site and I&#39;m helping with content collection. We&#39;re getting close to launch so I&#39;ve been extra busy gathering up resource materials, formatting them, and uploading to the site. It&#39;s a Drupal-based site so luckily the uploading is relatively simple. (someone else built the site, someone far techier than I am!) </p>
<p> Anyway it&#39;s been really eye-opening to see all the work that goes into planning a website. The site should be really great resource for anyone interested in using digital storytelling in their community work. I&#39;ll keep you posted on when we launch.</p>
<p> Other news:</p>
<p>--Fellow VISTAs Naomi Jimenez and Brittney Fosbrook came to <a href="http://www.storycenter.org" target="_blank">CDS</a> to do a digital storytelling <a href="http://www.storycenter.org/workshops.html">workshop</a> a few weeks ago. Yay! Hopefully they will post their stories on Blip.tv to share them. It was good to have a little VISTA reunion...I hope we can collaborate further on digital storytelling work with their organizations.</p>
<p> --I finally got an external hard drive to hold all my work! Thanks goodness. I&#39;ve been having a lot of issues staying organized because there hasn&#39;t been one computer where I can work all the time. I&#39;d been daydreaming about this <a href="http://www.powermax.com/product/LaCie_Rugged_All-Terrain_Hard_Drive_80GB_Hi-Speed_USB_2.0/d-lac-301008.html" target="_blank">portable drive</a> from LaCie and voila! CDS came though and now I&#39;ve got it in my hot little hands. </p>
<p>--Speaking of hard drives and such, we also just got two new flash drives to use in our workshops. They are super handy, especially since we often need to transfer files from machine to machine, Mac to PC, etc. We found these <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820134462">2 gb flash drives</a> for just $20, can&#39;t complain about that. What we do complain about is the way our flash drives tend to grow legs and walk away from our workshops. This time we&#39;ve attached smurf keychains to the drives, we&#39;ll see if it makes them a little trickier to just stuff into your pocket. I ran across these other ideas for how to make <a href="http://www.freshlysqueezedflash.com/projects/projects.html">USB flash drive modifications</a>, seems like good clean CTC VISTA fun and an anti-theft measure, too.  Maybe I can make one out of the VISTA robot?</p>

<p>A coworker just suggested I turn this into a one-day workshop for kids.  Maybe even go to some electronics store and ask them to donate some flash drives even.   This project has got a cooool factor to it.   </p>

				<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Hey Pink House, say what! </p>
<p>Well the kids at the Pink House continue to amaze me with their dedication to the programs hosted there.</p>
<p>They are growing leaps and bounds due to the different programs offered here at the Neighborhood Resource Center. I can honestly say I can see this community beginning to embrace the PINK HOUSE in their community. Dondre and Darius Simmons presented a service learning project called Zig the Pig to the Ardmore/Sherwood Forest neighborhood association on last month. They are the get this ZIG Ambassadors for  the  project representing two schools ( St. Andrews Middle and Stono Park Elementary).They are also my newphews (oh I&#39;m just so proud of how far they&#39;ve come since they came here!) This is a first in the history of the community to have children as a part of the community meeting.  Check out the first video we made!</p>
<p> What&#39;s A Zig Ambassador?  </p>
<p>    Go PINK HOUSE, SAY WHAT! </p>
<p>This group of kids created a commercial with the help of our parent involvement program here hosted at the PINK HOUSE. One  of the parents used countless hours to assist the children in creating a video which they  spliced and diced until they got Zig II.  </p>
<p>The  PINK HOUSE KIDS are now working on a computerized radio show  to be hosted on Blogtalkradio.com. Wait to you see (or should I say hear) all the hard work these kids have put into this project.  </p>
<p>Our prospective date to air is April 20,2007. Yes, that tomorrow, and boy am I nervous! I can only image how the kids are feeling about know. The time will be 4:30pm til 5:30pm. </p>
<p>On last week the local radio station who has partnered with us to make the radio show a reality,  invited our kids to the radio station to see how radio shows work behind the scenes. They really got a lot of good information and they got a chance to talk on the radio to see how it feels.  Hats off  to Citadel Broadcasting for their involvement in the community. Thanks Ms. Toby Smith from Heaven Talk 1390 am  and Gentry Via for his time and dedication to the community and to the PINK HOUSE KIDS! </p>
<p>Listen out for WPHK that those (WONDERFUL PINK HOUSE KIDS). </p>
<p>The Ardmore/Sherwood Forest Newsletter has a new face  thanks to Rev. C. King and our new edition Ms. Shirley Washington. They took my amaturistic attempt at community reporting  to a whole new level of community organizing, and communicating with the community.  Hats off ladies, You did a great job!</p>
<p>Our next event is an appreciation meeting for stakeholders in the community. The meeting will be the first of it&#39;s kind. It will be hosted outside with food and awards to say thank you to businesses in the neigborhood who  care about The Ardmore/Sherwood Forest community.  </p>
<p>Well, I got some much to do and so little time.......</p>
<p>Renae Out...........</p>

				<p>I recently heard about this new tool that Google offers through its Maps page. Basically, the tool connects you via phone (for free!) to any business you search for on Google Maps. This works for long distance or local calls. It could be of great use to non-profits trying to save a little money, if you&#39;re at a phone that does not allow calls outside a certain area, or even if you&#39;re at a pay phone.</p>
<p> So, here&#39;s how it works:</p>
<p>1) Navigate to <a href="http://maps.google.com/" target="_blank" title="Google Maps">Google Maps</a>. </p>
<p>2) Under the search text box, click on the link for &quot;Find businesses.&quot;</p>
<p>3) Type in the name of the business in the first box and an approximate location in the second box. Then search. You should get a result similar to below (I searched for my org., the Pangea Foundation, in San Diego):</p>
<p> <img src="http://digitalartscorps.org/files/user963/00.gif" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="448" height="222" align="top" /></p>
<p>4) Once here, there are two places you can select &quot;Call&quot; - in the left side listing or in the little pop-up on the map. The following screen appears when &quot;Call&quot; is selected:</p>
<p><img src="http://digitalartscorps.org/files/user963/01.gif" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="291" height="211" /> </p>
<p>5) Now, you enter whatever phone number you want to use to call the business (i.e., your cell phone, office phone, pay phone, etc.) and click &quot;Connect for free.&quot; Google will immediately call you (the number you just provided). As soon as you answer you will hear ringing as you are connected (for free!) to the business you wanted to call. (If you are using a cell phone, you will still be using your minutes, but otherwise there are no fees.)</p>
<p>6) In the picture, this is the link for the <a href="http://maps.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=52512&amp;topic=1467" target="_blank" title="Learn More link">Learn More</a> option. </p>
<p>Hope that&#39;s useful to someone! </p>
