				<p>I don't have much news to report since last time. We're a bit busier this month because I work with a mentoring program and it's National Mentoring Month. Thus, we're holding an event to thank our mentors and doing a few other odds and ends to celebrate the month.</p>
<p>Last week I attended a meeting with other non-profits in the community hosted by the United Way. They are beginning a campaign to assist the non-profits in the area with recruiting volunteers. They are particularly focusing on targeting businesses to recruit their employees. This is fantastic because we're always looking for more volunteers and this is one of the aspects of my job. The United Way held an event in Jacksonville, Florida that is along similar lines and was hugely successful. Hopefully Charlottesville can do the same. </p>
<p>Now that I'm about halfway through with AmeriCorps sometimes I feel a little helpless. Firstly, there are some ideas or projects I would like to implement but I know I'm only here for another seven months so I'm not sure I could get them started in that time. On the one hand seven months seems like a long time but on the other hand, I’ve learned that projects always move slower than one expects. Secondly, a lot of the difficulty I feel my organization faces simply has to do with manpower (or womanpower since all are staff are women). The people here are amazing and I think if we could clone them, then we’d be in great shape. From the standpoint of capacity building, I'm not really sure how to tackle this problem. I'm overseeing a few unpaid interns this spring, which will help to an extent but it still only a temporary solution to a long-term problem. Of course, I know that this problem is pervasive especially in the non-profit world and thus, we all must simply find a way to function as best we can.</p>

				<p>Happy New Year everyone,<br />
      I am still working on the Ticket to Work Program. Now I am learning  marketing and working to develop liaisons with other national, state, and local organizations and clinical networks interested in improving job access, reducing disability prejudice, and developing competent ways for underserved people and communities to find employment.<br />
       It’s been a challenge for me trying to juggle all the new responsibilities I have acquired. But that is where teamwork comes in to play. It’s important to know that your colleges are there. I have learned to ask for help when need it and not try to do it all myself.<br />
        Did you know that all your answers about social security are right there on the social security website <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/" title="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/">http://www.socialsecurity.gov/</a>. This is one of the best resources I have found. There are links to disability world too.<br />
       I look forward to the getting more and more people into the job market. And when people discover themselves wow I love that. It’s very rewarding for me to be able to motivate people and help them get around their disabilities and turn them into ability.</p>

				<p>Happy New Year !<br />
Well first things first. Christmas was great! It was a little scary there at first. We actually had no gifts to give to the kids because of the economy thing. Porter Guad usually gives us gifts for the kids at the PINK HOUSE but this year they didn't think they would be able to give our kids anything. I searched everywhere. I wrote request to many different organizations, Everyone turned us down. I was beginning to think that the economy had really done us in as far as there being any Christmas presents at the PINK HOUSE  but then Santa came to town. My first resolution is I do believe in Santa.  I do..I do. I..do.</p>
<p>Ho-Ho-Ho. Our parents really came through in a big way as well. We had a slammin Christmas party. The food was great. The teen leader at the PINK HOUSE wrote and directed their own Christmas play. The kids all were apart of the program. The parents love it, the staff loved it and the kids had a blast.Well guys here comes resolution number 2. Parent involvement is the backbone of any good program. So keep trying to get more parents involved with the community programs in their community. And before you know it Christmas was over and the New Year has rolled in. </p>
<p>We actually won't open until January 26, 2009. The economy has really been a boomer. It has touched a number of agencies in the Charleston area and it has reared it ugly head for us as well. It only motivates me to be more creative with finding services for our kids.  So I have been working on a proposal to send out to the local businesses in the community. I know everyone is feeling the pinch but maybe we will be able to get some kind of in-kind or financial response from the proposal. </p>
<p>Our kids had a  Health Rocks presentation to do at the local Boys and Girls Club in the City of Charleston just before Thanksgiving. The Boys and Girls Club program closed the day before we got there due to financial difficulties. I heard that the City of Charleston is trying to help get that program running again but wow it's rough out here! The kids will be doing a  Health Rocks presentation at Mary Ford Elementary School for 100 kids. It going to be great! I transport them as well as advise them, but they really don't need my help they are great. The presenter are 5th through 8th graders and they present to kids from the ages of<br />
8-12.<br />
Well wish me luck with the proposal.<br />
Renae Out</p>

				<p>First off, Happy New Year!  2009!  Woot!  The calendar year here at Aspiration wound down sans Gunner.  Gunner was running around the world for about 6 weeks, leaving me and my coworker Mike to keep all the ducks in a row here in the Bay.  I thought it would be a bad situation but we ended up fine with our little buddy Skype helpin' us out.  December was kind of a half-month just because I left for Christmas but I can confidently say that we got a lot of work done before shutting down for a couple of weeks.  </p>
<p>We've started to amp up the work on a website called ANSWR, which will basically be a sort of one-stop resource for general information on nonprofit technology implementation.  For example, we'll have content aimed at nonprofits starting out (e.g. "What's the best free email client for a mid-sized nonprofit?").  We're working with the people from Idealware and hopefully getting a lot of help from people in the sphere like Beth Kanter and Amy Sample Ward.  The cool thing is that Gunner is so incredibly well-connected.  It's ridiculous really.  Any time I find some awesome tech blog or hear about some nonprofit guru, he's like "sammy?  yeah, he can throw down whiskey like water..."  </p>
<p>I'm only now feeling up-to-speed on things in the nonprofit technology arena enough to talk about it on my own when people ask me things like "What are your thoughts on Joomla vs. Drupal?" or "Why is it bad to use Google docs/apps exclusively for my organization?"  It's a nice feeling to know that i can actually help people on my own now.  But at the same time, i feel kind of like 5 months behind.  I just think about what I could be doing now if I came into the job with the knowledge that i have now.  but on second thought, i guess that's the same for any job, for anyone, ever.</p>
<p>We've also been trying to up our social media presence with me pulling official Social Source Commons Twitter duty (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/ssc_tweets" title="www.twitter.com/ssc_tweets">www.twitter.com/ssc_tweets</a>) as well as branching out commenting in the blogosphere (Amy Sample Ward's blog is awesome and she might be the nicest person on earth).  I realize more and more about how just being a social media person for your organization can be a full time job.  There's so much to read, so many conversations to get involved in on Twitter, blogs, mailing lists...  I don't know how Beth Kanter does it...  </p>
<p>I've decided to organize my work schedule as kind of a regular week routine with designated days and times of day to do certain things so we'll see how good I am at organizing work stuff instead of getting to stuff as it comes.  I'll let you know how it goes (because let's face it, you're all dying to know).  Anyway, don't cry for me Argentina.  The truth is i never left you.</p>

	    <p>We do a lot of work with organizations that have sensitive information (e.g. immigrant-advocate groups that have alien-status info and stuff like that or direct-action protest groups) and Google has been known to fork over that info when court-ordered.  There have also been a few situations like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://blogoscoped.com/forum/22209.html" title="http://blogoscoped.com/forum/22209.html">http://blogoscoped.com/forum/22209.html</a></p>
<p>where a gmail account is just deleted.  Bam.  Gone.  This case here is really a matter of always backing up your email/information but you get the picture.  For many MANY things, Google produces the best option for a given SaaS but your data isn't safe from the government (insert paranoid catch phrase here) and sometimes it's not even safe from Google.  But for the most part Google Docs is a GREAT option for nonprofits as long as they realize that there is a legitimate possibility of loss and data getting into people's hands that they may not like.</p>

				<p>Second day back after the holidays, and already so much to do! Since Laura and I are staying on for at least a partial year, we were asked to write up a list of projects we would like to work on. I'm posting the list (there are some CTC VISTA related items on here), any feedback is of course welcomed!</p>
<p><strong>Americorps VISTA Digital Storytelling Project</strong> (Laura &amp; Carrie)</p>
<p>Pursue digital storytelling collaboration with CTC VISTA, facilitating workshops for current VISTAs (and potentially alums) in particular geographical areas (specifically Bay Area &amp; East Coast/Boston to start).  CTC VISTA Project can use stories on the web for recruitment and/or we can create a DVD for them to use for general outreach. </p>
<p>From CDS:  Access to lab for Bay Area workshop, potential plane tickets to Boston (can pursue sponsorship from CTC, Laura will already be in Boston for a weekend late March)</p>
<p>Timeline:  Bay Area workshop in mid-February, Boston workshop in early/late March (depending on their schedules).</p>
<p><strong>Digital Storytelling Podcast </strong>(Laura lead, Carrie assist)</p>
<p>Monthly podcast on what’s going on in digital storytelling – interviews with community partners, participants, and/or facilitators as well as audio from stories.  Not sure if it’s best to host this through CDS, International Day, or Stories for Change.  Extensive collaboration between the podcast content and content from the BCM show is possible, but unique content would be developed for each.</p>
<p>From CDS:  Story suggestions and staff cooperation.</p>
<p>Timeline:  First podcast in early February!</p>
<p><strong>CDS Berkeley Community Media Show</strong> (Carrie lead, Laura assist)</p>
<p>Monthly television show to air on BCM channels. Similar to Podcast, but with stronger emphasis on broadcast of digital stories. Will promote CDS events/workshops, themes of Stories for Change site, etc.</p>
<p>From CDS: Story suggestions and staff cooperation.</p>
<p>Timeline: First show in early February!</p>
<p><strong>Other Community-Based Workshops</strong> (Carrie &amp; Laura)</p>
<p>Develop projects and community partnerships that CDS wants to pursue but doesn’t have the staff resources to support.  Potentially thematic.  Possible to do something politically hot (marriage equality) or supporting the International Day (immigration-themed workshops).  Also possible to create a larger project in connection with the Americorps digital storytelling project around issues of youth/young adult activism and civic engagement.  Potential partner organizations to approach:  Girls for a Change, Young People For, San Francisco Urban Service Learning Project, etc.</p>
<p>From CDS:  Access to lab</p>
<p>Timeline:  March/April and beyond (after Americorps workshop series)</p>
<p><strong>Online Community Outreach</strong> (Laura &amp; Carrie)</p>
<p>Manage CDS' presence in new media platforms -- Twitter, Facebook, Change.org, potential public blog (or regularly contributing to the International Day blog), etc.</p>
<p>From CDS:  Permission</p>
<p>Timeline:  Can start immediately</p>
<p><strong>Local Community Outreach</strong> (Laura &amp; Carrie)</p>
<p>Attend and represent CDS at local gatherings and meetings of non-profit media orgs (BAVC, Media Alliance, NAMAC), Community Technology Meet-Ups, etc.</p>

				<p>Greetings and HNY.  I’d like to report on what I’ve been up to lately.  I have travelled to Eastern Washington to give a training and to visit some of our clubs in that area.  The training went really well.  We’re trying to work with a group of university students at Central Washington University to have them provide training for families who receive computers from the TAP clubs.  Fortunately for us, they’re willing to travel a couple hours to give the trainings, for free and will even go into the homes of the recipients to train them.  Now it’s just a matter of picking a date and hoping people show up.  I also visited some clubs in Bridgeport and Brewster which were interesting.  It’s funny to see the different styles of the club leaders and what their kids are like.  Each club really has its own personality which is kind of cool.  Coming back from that trip I experienced, quite possibly, the worst driving conditions I had ever faced.  Coming back from Eastern Washington requires going over two mountain passes, which does not sound that terrible, and the first time I went, it wasn’t.  However, coming back over the passes, there was a lot (3-6 inches) of snow of the road, combined with a lot of snow falling from the sky.  It was probably the most intense couple hours in recent memory.  Anyway, one of our clubs had a computer distribution on 12/18 which apparently went pretty well.  Now it’s time to try and get the trainings happening and visit the clubs I haven’t been to yet.<br />
I had somewhat of an extended vacation in that because of the snow travelling to the office was pretty much impossible. I was, however, able to work from home which was enjoyable.  I’m looking forward to setting up some training for the recipients of the computers and having the rest of the distributions.      </p>
<p>ALSO!  I'm using my in-service training funds to take a class on CSS this Friday.  I'll let you know how it goes.</p>

				<p>Way back in September, I organized an event at Media Bridges for the third-annual <a href="http://www.onewebday.org" title="One Web Day">One Web Day</a>, which is a cool event that some of your organizations might be interested in participating in. </p>
<p>One Web Day is a sort of “Earth Day for the Internet,” that was celebrated Sept. 22 with virtual and in-person events in cities across the country to promote a free and open internet. The goal is to help people understand the possibilities the internet can offer to them, and motivate people to protect it as a public resource. </p>
<p>“People's lives now are as dependent on the Internet as they are on the basics like roads, energy supplies and running water," One Web Day founder Susan Crawford said in a <a href="http://onewebday.org/?page_id=596" title="news release">news release</a>. "We can no longer take that for granted and we must advocate for the Internet politically, and support its vitality personally." </p>
<p>This year's theme was the internet and its effect on democratic participation in an election year. So we planned a panel discussion on the topic of “The Next President, the Internet, and the Disconnected City,” where people in Cincinnati could talk directly to the presidential candidates’ telecommunications policy advisors, via <a href="http://www.skype.com" title="Skype">Skype</a>. We invited representatives from the Obama, McCain and Nader campaigns. Since Media Bridges is a non-partisan public access station, I hoped our event could include discussions of more candidates’ positions, but unfortunately the McCain and Nader campaigns could not send representatives. </p>
<p>Our lone panelist was Obama’s telecommunications advisor <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/about/who/staff/sohn" title="Gigi Sohn">Gigi Sohn</a>, who phoned in from Washington D.C. and we projected her image onto a projector screen. Our audience was small but enthusiastic, and included some students, cable access producers, bloggers, media activists, a lawyer, and one 11-year old. </p>
<p>Despite the 11-year-old, the event had nothing to do with my job developing the youth media program, but it was a good event planning practice and experience using some of the internet tools. We incorporated the internet in everything we did for the event, which was tedious and scary for me, but my fellow (non-CTC) VISTA Katie did the web work and patiently explained it to me. We downloaded a program that allowed us to record the video and audio from Skype (we had to pay for it but I’d be interested to know if anyone knows of free versions out there), and posted the entire event to a <a href="http://www.mediabridges.org/onewebday/" title="One Web Day page">One Web Day page</a> we created using <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" title="WordPress">WordPress</a>. The page also has a video from interviews we did with people at the downtown farmer’s market, where we asked people how they used the internet and what they’d like to see the new president do.</p>

				<p>Well, officially I am a waste of life as this is my very first field report! What took so long you may ask? Truth be told, I just really wanted to build the anticipation level to a high before instilling my wisdom upon future generations. </p>
<p>Honestly, I've spent a lot of the last five months(!) getting used to a new city and a work environment so there hasn't been a whole lot of opportunity to "stop and reflect", so to speak. I figure that a new year presents a good chance for me to put in perspective what I've been involved with and, also, what lies ahead.</p>
<p>I came to A Home Within, my organization, with a pretty vague idea of what I would be doing, and the job description I was provided with didn't really help, something along the lines of "help implement Salesforce, increase our technology capacities, do our laundry etc." But, if I wanted to go down a really specific job path, I wouldn't have joined the VISTA project.</p>
<p>After the proper introductions, it didn't take long for the people in my small office to realize my dirty little secret: that I am not a technology guru. I'm not even a tech apprentice, I'm more like, let's say a "tech plebian" i.e. I know how to use some stuff but I'm not gonna be teaching classes anytime soon. Anyways, what began after that was a protracted, but healthy process of cross pollination between the needs of my organization and the skills that I "bring to the table". (I don't know if its necessary to use quotation marks around everything but I'm doing it so that if something I write falls short you will know that it once existed in a different, more appropriate context). What skills, do you ask? Well:</p>
<p>I can read (if the font's big and there's a lot of pictures)<br />
I can change a tire pretty quickly<br />
I can make pretty strong coffee<br />
I used to be good at tennis<br />
I've beaten Prince of Persia for MS-DOS!</p>
<p>Sorry. In all seriousness, being in the Bay Area has really helped in my seemingly neverending quest to implement Salesforce for my organization. My got the licenses a while back, but as some of you probably know, its not quite as simple as that. I spent about three months banging my head against a computer and cursing out online tutorials before we finally made some progress when I was able to get a volunteer from the Salesforce Foundation to help us design the platform. This happened in early December, and since then he and I have been working on the design and are aiming to have it be ready by late January!</p>
<p>I was also able to switch over our organization's web hosting to Google and we're working on internally developing a new website for our Fostering Art program. Speaking of which, one of the highlights of my time here at A Home Within has been helping out with the Fostering Art class, which is a digital photography program we host twice a week for former and current foster youth. Over the course of the semester we took several field trips to local arts organizations, did a couple of studio shoots, printed in a local darkroom, and help and end of semester exhibition highlighting the students' work. We're looking forward to expanding some of the curiculum this coming year to include a digital video workshop, along with hosting a large opening at a local gallery. </p>
<p>So, I guess my attempt at making a concise summary of my experience thus far has failed. Lets just say I have been making slow, but steady, progress in catching up to the tech curve, and I think things are finally on track for our organization to step into the 21st century and finally get rid of the little kid that rides the bike that powers our computers. I'd like to thank Matt, Morgan, and Josh for helping me along the way. I wouldn't be here today if it wern't for them (well that's a lie, but I may have been committed by now). I also want to say "hi Mom!". Keep on fighting poverty, or at least live in it.</p>
<p>Be seeing you!</p>

				<p>Happy new year, from Kentucky.  Well, our holiday call in show went very well. It was exciting to be part of such a cool event.  We received over 200 calls from across the country from a great variety of people: mothers, fathers, sons and daughters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, community activists, members of the religious community, and many others. It was both inspiring and kind of saddening. All these families broken up during the holiday season. All these people who can't see or talk to their loved ones. I mean, this isn't new to me, but hearing 200 calls of it was intense. </p>
<p>Right before Christmas vacation I was interviewed for the local CBS station about the project, which was really cool. They said they'd post the video online, but haven't yet. But here's the write-up from their website: <a href="http://www.wkyt.com/news/headlines/36608809.html" title="http://www.wkyt.com/news/headlines/36608809.html">http://www.wkyt.com/news/headlines/36608809.html</a><br />
My first TV interview!  I was thankful for the training I've had in other projects I've worked for to be able to answer the hard questions I was asked about why prisoners deserve to have such programs. </p>
<p>Now in this new year I'm continuing my work on our StoryLine project on our website, adding new calls as they come in on our Skype line and making connections with community poetry leaders to record prisoner poems. I will also aide in our campaign with the Virgin Islands Prison Project to bring the 130 male prisoners who are now housed in Virignia back to the VI.  I'll be doing the research and outreach for this next campaign.  </p>
<p>I also continue my work facilitating a poetry workshop at the local women's prison. I hope to produce a CD of them reading their work at the end of this workshop. I think that would be a cool addition to the anthology we had decided on producing, and it will make my work in this prison even more focused to the work I do at Appalshop.</p>
<p>We got a grant from Dorris Duke, too, which is really exciting. Some big ones are about to be submitted as well. Keep your fingers crossed for us!</p>

				<p>Since my last post, we gave a PowerPoint presentation to the representatives from Microsoft foundation. The presentation went well, I had Lou August, the Wilderness technology representative, myself and two other members of Wildtech/CCNV relay information on the workings of our organization. The Word and Excel classes have been suspended until January 19. 2009, but also during this time we have set aside time to give the staff of CCNV necessary office training skills.<br />
 I also purchased training books with the funds we raised thru the introductory classes; these books were purchased from Axzo press at <a href="http://www.axzopress.com" title="www.axzopress.com">www.axzopress.com</a>. These books come in student and instructor’s editions, I purchased the instructors edition which come with software called CertBlaster.  I installed the CertBlaster software on all twelve Media Center computers, this program is used to give pre and post assessments of individuals. The assessments are at this time on Word and Excel; in the future I plan to install other of the company’s evaluating programs. The company has a ILT series which deals with Microsoft Office, a CRISP series that deals with Sales, Customer Service, Management and Leadership, Project Management, OSHA, Retailing, Human Resources, Communication, Change Management and more. In addition, they also carry ComTIA press titles that I have interest for future training programs.<br />
Finally, I have been in constant contact with an instructor from the Prince George Community College who is willing to train me and others to be instructors in A+ and Cisco certifications.</p>

<p>I hope you have all been enjoying the holiday season and a much-needed break before the start of 2009. I had a great time at home in Pittsburgh, but am ready to return to NYC and ring in the new year in style!</p>
<p>As for the J-O-B, it has a been a busy few weeks at Grassroots.org. I recently started to manage our online fundraising efforts, beginning with a <A href="http://grassroots.org/holiday giving">holiday giving campaign</a>. Last month I took a one-day Internet Fundraising course at NYU, so I was eager to get started by updating our online donation page (Tip: make sure your donation form is extrememly simple and asks for no unneccessary information - this means even eliminating a title field from your form. Oh yes, and Network for Good reccomends "Blazing a trail to your donation page" - place a DONATE button all over!).</p>
<p>In addition to the fundraising campaign, we launched a new tool this month in the Grassroots.org toolbox - graphic design! The program works just like our web design tool  - by matching volunteers with nonprofits in need. In the first week alone, we had 3 of our members sign-up for volunteers to help them design logos, letterhead, etc. Which reminds me, if any of you talented VISTAs are graphic designers and are looking for some great experience, hit up our <A href="http://volunteer.grassroots.org/volunteer-now">volunteer board</a>.   </p>
<p>Okay, I better go pack so I don't miss my flight! HAPPY 2009!!!!!!!</p>
<p>-Laura</p>

				<p>Less than a month to go with my life as a VISTA. All I can say is it has been a long and bumpy ride.  But worth it in the end. </p>
<p>I'm beginning to switch gears and take on the new roles that will be part of my job description as a "real" employee here at Tincan. I will be continuing to run the history program which if anyone is interested in learning about eastern Washington history take a look at <a href="http://history.tincan.org" title="http://history.tincan.org">http://history.tincan.org</a>. I'm very proud of the accomplishments that I've contributed to for the history program. Two grants awarded during my service that I assisted in researching and running. Revamping the look of the website. Adding hundreds of artifacts and documents to the archive, building community relationships, and getting the word out about this program. </p>
<p>I wish everyone the best of luck with their service and hope that it is as fulfilling as mine has been.</p>

<p>On the web I'm working on further developing our Drupal website that's being used at Somerville high school.  Some of the things I'm adding are a grading feature which which allows the teacher to calculate grades and share them privately with each student, as well as an "assignment board" feature which will sort all projects with their associated content, due dates, groups and so on.  I'm also creating a resource page on the organization website where al of our curriculum materials can be stored and downloaded.</p>

				<p>The past month was probably the most successful for my VISTA project so far.   While this was due in no small part to the groundwork of the previous months, over the course of only the last few weeks I trained (trainers and students), recruited volunteers, made new community contacts, and produced media.  I credit this productivity with a) working independently and b) communicating frequently about my work to others to involve them and get their feedback.</p>
<p>	Mid-November started slowly, as I helped the Shows group (books concerts and events for the IMC) assume their own responsibilities, by helping to draft a new contract with the IMC Finance group, updating their Drupal <a href="http://shows.ucimc.org/">site</a> and web calendar, and training a volunteer on meeting facilitation, sound, and web/calendar administration.   Having that particular group grow to be more independent and capable frees me from a lot of extra, small tasks, and saves the rest of the IMC time and effort, as well.  With more time to focus on the broader goals of my assignment, I have been gradually giving closer attention to the Production group that I helped start in the summer.  The Production group (site in development) manages the IMC’s media production room, loans equipment to community projects, produces original content, and offers training on multimedia.  Along with Production volunteers, Nicole Pion and I started planning an IMC Film Festival for February 6-8, 2009, which will last three days and showcase a variety of genres, especially work by local/regional filmmakers, and will also include art, music, and food from local sponsoring restaurants.</p>
<p>	Other accomplishments of the Production group, which now contains a core of six independent journalist/producers, were four new videos (a total of 3.5 hours) that we have shared with Urbana Public Television and which will also be available online at our site and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/UrbanaChampaignIMC">YouTube channel</a>.  Coverage ranged from stories about a local activist, IMC concert footage, People’s Potluck Thanksgiving, and a Proposition 8 protest.  A group of 3 volunteers filmed performances and interviews at a benefit concert for our radio station.  I have also started helping the IMC’s <a href="http://www.books2prisoners.org/">Books to Prisoners</a> program with a video project that they will begin shooting and editing in the New Year to highlight their presence in town, their training, and the prison libraries that they staff.</p>
<p>	In the course of recruiting volunteers to produce new media, I did quite a bit of editing myself, especially audio, and it turns out that this is a modest source of extra income for the host organization, which makes it worthwhile.  More valuable, however, is the opportunity to instruct others on how to edit.  Between Shows, Production, and Books to Prisoners members, I trained three individuals who will now be ready to train others on the basics of production and got them to think about how they can utilize media technology to further their groups’ goals.  Over the next few months, I will be compiling my tutorials (and other online sources) for a wiki that our VISTA supervisor Josh King is developing for the IMC (Josh has chosen <a href="http://twiki.org/">Twiki</a>, as it has revision control and is used by the global <a href="http://www.indymedia.org/en/index.shtml">Indymedia</a> network).</p>
<p>	There was quite a bit of interest in learning audio recording and editing this past month, with IMC members attending a variety of public lectures, discussions, or wanting to produce their own interviews or radio commentaries.  I offered a series of three one-on-one tutorials on recording field audio (using a Zoom H2); compiling a musical set list (ala the quickly arcane term, “mix tape”) for radio; and recording and editing speech for use on radio or film.  I chose the free and easy <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> for the training, and even though I know a lot of people are familiar with how to use it, I’ll attach my quick guide here just in case anyone is interested.   There are many more tips and tutorials <a href="http://audacityteam.org/wiki/index.php?title=Tutorials">here</a>. </p>
<p>	The final area in which I feel I made great progress was at the IMC’s community radio station, <a href="http://www.wrfu.net/">WRFU</a>.  First, I revived the station’s Tech group, which had been inactive since before I started as a VISTA.  The Tech group maintains studio equipment, updates and repairs software and Internet connectivity, and offers technical guidance for membership training.   After a few e-mails about the lack of tech support, a core group of 4-6 of us decided to set up a new computer at the DJ desk, fix and label cables and mixer inputs, and begin a construction plan for more shelves, storage, and a patchbay.  In September I had been responsible for training dozens of airshifters, but in the process of bringing back the Tech group, we realized that we were training more trainers (and training ourselves to be better experts and instructors at the station).  Two University of Illinois graduate students in the Library Sciences department finished their radio automation and music library training manual, which I had been supervising since the fall.  This manual, now available in our office next to the studio, gives DJs and tech support step-by-step instructions on how to add local music, PSAs, and other pre-produced shows to our non-live rotation, how to classify content as clean, and how to edit it if it is not clean.  The system is based on <a href="http://www.zarastudio.es/index.php?section=main&amp;lang=en">ZaraRadio</a>, iTunes, and the <a href="http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/">Juice</a> podcast player, and the volunteers used <a href="http://www.karenware.com/">Karen’s Directory Printer</a> to generate a station inventory.  Nicole and I visited the Library Science department for presentations on their projects and to represent the IMC, and while there we learned about other great community engagement/technology instruction programs that are going on in our town.  Earlier this week the librarians even thanked me by having me on their final show of the semester for an interview about my role as a CTC VISTA.</p>

				<p>I am currently helping out a member who is making a video for his church group. I taught him how to do everything but he keeps taping in 16:9 and putting it onto a 4:3 dvd. So It is like a widescreen trying to fit in regular screen so everything looks zoomed in. The problem I was having was  where he keeps changing the settings, he either does it in the camera, final cut, or i dvd.   idk, but it took a day of making dvd's to figure it out. And currently the is another member working on her project, I don't know what she is doing but i keep hearing mr. roboto by styx coming out of her headphones.    Last week I was helping another member who a few years ago went to peru. He filmed it all in LP.  so  i had to help him figure out how to capture it. We just took it straight from mini-dv to dvd. it took him three years to do it, and i figured out the problem in half an hour, that is because some of the other employees here didn't stop to figure out what needs to be done to help this man.  he was very gratefull.  But  even though he was a member no one had figured out what needed to be done. Anyways, wattsup VISTAS!!   My work life couldn't be better, I really feel part of this community.  recently I've gotten myself into this videogame playing rut.  Cuz I started  a show of my own here at ltc called"players Point"    its video mixing while playing video games, real trippy, and the colors come out good when i capture straight from the 360.     Its fun when i get to spend some of every saturday playing on a huge screen.      The only thing is I just wish there were some young beautiful women who were into digital media,  we don't get alot of those.  oh and thats Gloria. shes cool.</p>

				<p>Everyone’s been breathing a collective sigh of relief here at 119 Gallery. On Dec 6 our first annual Jazz Brunch went on without a hitch. I was really impressed to see how many great people came together to give their time and effort to make sure that the event went smoothly. In hindsight, there are a few things that we might be doing differently next year, but it was still a good event. We had 17 people attend. Most of them had never been to the gallery before and it was nice to be able to tell them about what we do here.<br />
So- now I have time to really focus on other things without having to worry about the extra pressure of working on the fundraiser. Starting next week I’m going to start building some focus groups out of our constituents. I’m hoping to find out what types of events and programming we should expand upon so that we can get more people engaged in the gallery.<br />
Other than that, things have been okay. I promised myself I wouldn’t complain about the weather anymore but this situation bears mentioning. My birthday was December 12. The night before, the power went out. Being a recent transplant to New England and all its extremes in weather, the subsequent drop in temperature (our heat went out too) was waaaaaay too much for me to handle.<br />
So I figured I’d just go to bed and the problem would work itself out in the morning. Which, of course, it hadn’t. It took about 30 minutes to force myself to get out from under the blankets that morning. I went to work, assuming that the problem would fix itself by the time I got home. Which, of course, it hadn’t.<br />
It also hadn’t the next day. Or the day after that.<br />
Luckily we had a place to stay about an hour away that was pretty cozy and warm, but the power went out on my birthday. But then- the same thing happened to 350,000 other people in three states that night so I guess I don’t have much of a right to complain. I’m just saying…</p>

				<p>Just a couple of more weeks to the New Years! Ever since I got back from Italy, I have felt more positive about my work with CAPAY. I was glad that the outreach I did for CAPAY’s youth leadership symposium churned out 130 plus attendees. I heard the event was very successful, with students and teachers wanting more support and resources from our org throughout the school year. Next I’m working with the high school students to send out surveys, e-mail blasts and to work on compiling all the database info to engage more youth into community projects.</p>
<p>The other main focus is the redevelopment of the Website/Media Site. It seems that now I have to start from scratch because the org wanted a former alumni of the org to freelance the project. This is one of the worse things to do because that alumni has another full-time job. Though I am way past the professional development phase of my service, I feel like I have to learn to build this site from scratch. My supervisor has suggested that if I am going to learn a program or software from scratch, then I should consider Dreamweaver, but I have done research on Drupal. I just need to master a program to build a site and have it easily manageable for new staff. I have like a 7-8 month period to produce a site for my org. Any suggestions for my best options?</p>
<p>And with my Dorchester Youth Initiative program, I am finally closer to getting the space at the VIET-AID community development center approved. We will begin running a couple of workshops in January and February. In March, the 10 wk program will begin. I have supporting staff, 3  UMASS college students from the Dorchester neighborhood, who are helping me plan community youth and adult programs, and developing the workshop series. I’m really excited about this project because I get to work with the Vietnamese American community. One of the first things we will be doing is a youth and an adult forum to encourage discussion that will help us assess and create a relevant program for youth (with the support of parents.)</p>
<p>Okay, that’s all folks! Until 2009!</p>

				<p>Since my <a href="http://ctcvista.org/node/1333" title="most recent report">most recent report</a> I have done mostly the same thing, coding on the web content management system that is tailored to periodical publication.  I wrote the code that sends e-mail to notify subscribers when a new edition comes out.  The first client for this tool went public yesterday:  <a href="http://marylandcommons.org" />Maryland Commons</a>.</p>
<p>However, a few days ago, I took a role in explaining to two new volunteers what's desired of them, which has to do with accounting and business analysis.  I received a "thank you" from the director for my write-up on those needs.  Several other volunteers offered their services recently, as well.  I drove the discussion that resulted in at least a provisional assignment of computers to workers.  I got the director to agree to a date to clean up the office so we can seat as many simultaneous workers as possible.</p>
<p>I've started looking into tools and procedures to improve the project management and timekeeping for the organization.</p>

			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p>This was a month for organizing people to be self-sufficient in producing content for local community radio, television, and the Internet.  From October 15 to November 15, I focused primarily on training volunteer citizen journalists while also staffing the media studio facilities at the IMC and facilitating meetings.   Like last month, I still had little time to write, but compensated for this with direct engagement and a lot of indirect service (with some direct service- but that seems unavoidable).</p>
<p>	Training this month consisted of several one-on-one sessions.  These included size tutorials with WRFU radio station airshifters, one with a volunteer new to live sound, one on PC audio recording/editing, and at least two sessions on video production (specifically, editing and DVD authoring).  As a companion to teaching, I provided technical support to different IMC working groups.  I helped Books to Prisoners upload their videos to YouTube and add some photos to their volunteer archive, produced promo spots for WRFU with a local volunteer, and tested and reconfigured the IMC’s sound system for live events.</p>
<p>	To further expand the IMC’s media programs, I coordinated the monthly IMC Video News October 2008 project, which was a series of short films for public-access TV.  Key among these was the November Ballot Township Referendum video, an educational film released prior to the November elections that informed local voters about a ballot issue that would increase funding for those living in extreme poverty in Champaign-Urbana.  The ballot referendum was not passed, but the making of and distribution of the film raised local awareness in an already high-profile national election.  I also organized a live radio production and interview on Ibogaine, a treatment for chemical addiction, and by the end of the work month had raised enough funds to purchase a new camcorder for the IMC.</p>
<p>	Finally, this month provided an opportunity to do more community organizing and to address my own concerns within the organization, described in last month’s field report.   One event was rather simple – an experimental music and a/v performance concert which also served as an opportunity for our volunteer film crew to learn production and editing.  Additionally, I helped fellow IMC VISTA Nicole Pion present a state AmeriCorps application to three IMC working groups.  This included drafting job descriptions for a Venue and Events Coordinator and News Media Coordinator.  We scheduled a VISTA meeting with representatives (there are no employees) of the IMC to address concerns that we were doing too much direct service at the expense of our capacity building project goals.  From this meeting, I developed a media training plan to better utilize community member’s talents and interests, in which groups who would like to use IMC services appoint two media support representatives to meet with me to go over their technology and press needs, upon which we draft a specific training schedule to meet their goals.</p>
