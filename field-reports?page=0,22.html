				<p><a href="http://connectthedisconnected.com/">Connect the Disconnected</a>, a new project started by Richard O'Bryant of Northeastern University and <a href="http://www.massimpact.org">MassIMPACT</a> board member, hosted a one-day conference on Saturday June 9th, 2007 entitled "Empowering Communities through Electronic Information Access: Public Policy and Effective Community Practices."  This free one day conference focused on opportunities, resources and strategies for bringing information technology to under served communities.  It had a relaxed format of panels, discussion, and digital storytelling screening.  We had a great mix of community activists, CTC VISTA members, housing development technology staff, and larger nonprofit organizations focused on this work.  Below are my notes on the panels with several great quotes from experts and on-the-ground workers alike.</p>
<p><strong>Panel 1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Susan O'Connor  - The Timothy Smith Network / Open Air Boston / Tech Goes Home</li>
<li>Gail Breslow  - Intel Computer Clubhouse</li>
<li>Theresa Ellis - Common Impact</li>
<li>Milton Irving - One Economy</li>
</ul>
<p>Richard O'Bryant, Northeastern University, acted as the panel facilitator and started the panel by citing that studies have shown that low income communities currently lack substantive social/political capital.  He asked how are members of this panel addressing this issue, using technology as a tool.</p>
<p>Susan-<br />
Timothy Smith Network is 40 organizations in greater Roxbury, housed in social service agencies that has served over 14,000 individuals, youth to seniors.  Their programs include standard computer literacy (job skills) and multimedia programming, with partnerships such as an astronomy program with MIT and a robotics program with Northeastern to do projects that encourage social justice purpose.  The Network has the goal to make it easier for people to come to the network and provide opportunities to "take the technology and max it's effectiveness on multiple levels."</p>
<p>Gail -<br />
The Computer Clubhouse approaches technology as a vehicle or medium to express their own interests and meet their own needs.  It's a program started 15 years ago at Computer Museum with the MIT Media Lab, and now it's 108 Clubhouses in 24 countries.  It serves ages 10-18 from low-income communities to come do digital media projects to express themselves with the help of adult mentors.  The unique learning approach because of idea to help young people to experience the joy of learning; to reconnect with joy of learning as young children.  It attracts many aspiring graffitti and hip hop musical artist members.  They know that community engagement needs to start with where members are at; so the Clubhouse is a place where youth have ownership of the experience and develop skills for future careers.</p>
<p>Theresa -<br />
Since social responsibility in the private sector is a big topic, Common Impact strives to strengthen community based organizations by leveraging human/individual capacity.  They ask of nonprofits, "how do you build the back office to remove barriers to make your programs more accessible?" through a 3 step process:<br />
1. perform a technology needs assessment<br />
2. write a road map / plan with technology based goals<br />
3. bring in team of volunteers from a partner to achieve one of the goals (average worth of $40K)<br />
There is an actual sensibility that private companies need to be able to measure and assess their work in the community: "Most interesting output of these projects is that people meet each other...50% of volunteers stay involved with the nonprofits after the initial project"</p>
<p>Milton -<br />
One Economy helps low income people understand the power of technology through the internet, in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Access thru broadband</li>
<li>Online content - what the is food for this internet superhighway? Such as the Beehive (education, health, financial literacy) or Town Hall 24/7 - civic engagement website launching next week; launching next week in New Orleans.</li>
<li>On-the-ground work - physically get housing developments wired and provide equipment, combine with training for youth and residents </li>
<li>One Global Economy - international initiatives</li>
<li>Bring IT Home - 50 different agencies that deal with affordable housing, change existing policies in ways to provide more affordable access to technology</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The panel then tried to answer some larger questions:</strong></p>
<p>How does policy play in role in connecting the disconnected?</p>
<p>Susan - Timothy Smith wouldn't be possible without the policies of Boston; the thinking that went into that was creating funding until 2019 to support these types of initiatives; commitment to programs such as Technology Goes Home, where participants get a non-interest bearing loans to purchase a computer for the home; also Mayor Menino is big on internet safety, such as partnering with Microsoft to provide iSafe programs to Boston Public Schools.  Also, there's the Open Air initiative that the Boston wireless access will be totally privately funded, but it's starting in Roxbuy, which is where the people who really need the low cost internet access but there needs to be some outreach to convince people that they NEED this type of access in their homes.  Check out an article in today's Boston Globe about rollout - <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/personaltech/articles/2007/06/09/hubs_wifi_rollout_starts_in_grove_hall_this_month/" title="http://www.boston.com/business/personaltech/articles/2007/06/09/hubs_wifi_rollout_starts_in_grove_hall_this_month/">http://www.boston.com/business/personaltech/articles/2007/06/09/hubs_wif...</a></p>
<p>Milton - It starts with education, around the marketing potential and purchasing power of people in places such as public assisted housing, for larger corporation.  "It's not about being good, it's about good business...but it's about the power in those numbers."  </p>
<p><strong>How can we further prove to companies that there's possibility and benefit to working toward this goal?</strong></p>
<p>Gail - It's about opening companies eyes to the possibilities.  For example Adobe was at first hesitant to donate software because they thought it'd be too advanced for youth in the Clubhouses to use.  After a short period of time of members using the software, Adobe visited and was amazed at the youth's progress with the software and the creativity of projects produced.</p>
<p>Theresa - "You have to be able to translate the message...and speak  to things that respects what both the nonprofits and for profits bring to the table."  There is a benefit of increased creativity of employees by placing them in volunteer situations at nonprofits, and for profits need to be made aware of that. </p>
<p><strong>Even if we get the computers, we need bring in people with the skills to teach the community members how to use the technology.  How do we get there? Lois Lee - (United Granite Church in Grove Hall neighborhood)</strong></p>
<p>Susan - There is a myth that says that the digital divide has been closed, but there is really still a need to provide physical tools for access.  But there's also more awareness among corporations and private citizens that there's a threat to data security if they donate used hardware, so this creates a barrier for computer donation for refurbishing.   Also, there's the idea of "Better Living Through the Internet."  There needs to be more education for community members about how the internet can be used to help them choose the right healthcare, to get food stamps, and even for homework help for their children.</p>
<p><strong>There has been a lot of emphasis on youth programs...what about adult learners, such as ESL and learning disabilities in DOE sponsored programs?  Where is the connection between adult education and community development?</strong></p>
<p>Gail - There is a learning approach used in the Computer Clubhouse is applicable for people of other ages as well.  The Clubhouse engages adults as mentors for the youth, but the youth tend to know more about the technology.  Volunteers at the Clubhouse have had their own lives transformed by their work with youth and an expansion of their creativity.  Barriers to the use of technology can be broken by creating learning experiences with new motivations to create.  </p>
<p><strong>What are you doing around technology for those with disabilities?  And educating trainers in these community technology centers around these issues?</strong></p>
<p>Milton - Through partnerships with agencies and city mayoral offices, we ask social service agencies how can we use the internet to better serve your clients.  These developed tools need to be adapted for the specific constituents.</p>
<p>Another resource may be the Adaptive Environment Center has a background in universal design in architecture and American Disabilities Act - they might have resources for community technology.</p>
<p><strong>How do we address language barriers? Especially with the parents of youth who don't speak English?</strong></p>
<p>Gail - There has been a challenge to involve parents of Clubhouse youth that don't understand the work their children do each day in the Clubhouse, both because of their language and technology literacy.  The Clubhouse has had success by having recognition events for the youth and inviting the parents to come celebrate their children.  "It's relationship building, it's the start of something that can grow from there when you can look them in the eye."  The added benefit in the Boston Clubhouse at the Museum of Science is that it brings adults, who may have never thought of attending the Museum, to a new learning experience of their own.</p>
<p>Richard - An issue with literacy of ESL adults is that they might not have literacy in English, but also not in their native language as well.  The problem needs to be addressed from a larger adult education perspective.</p>
<p><strong>How do we get parents more involved with their children's homework using technology? - Antonio (Humboldt Tech Center staff) </strong></p>
<p>There are sites and software such as MyBPS - through Boston Public Schools site and Power Schools - an online utility for student management that sends text message to parents with homework.  The challenge is to get the teachers and the school administration signed on to using these tools.</p>
<p><strong>As we try to close the digital divide, how much more is there to go?  Once we have the hardware, we do we go from there? - Chris Greer, SMS Housing Development, Roxbury</strong></p>
<p>Milton - It's a tough question to ask if we're every going to be there?  It's about people becoming self sufficient, not just the access but the destination point for information.  The problem is that this point always changes, there are always new problems and changes.  </p>
<p>Theresa - The question come back to equality, the gap between the have's and have-nots?  How do you think about this problem from a larger the terms a policy standpoint?</p>
<p>The digital divide isn't going to go away, because the challenges change.  For example, you can give them access to the internet, but then you have bandwidth issues.  "They're online but they're not sufficiently online."  There's also the issue of network neutrality.  "Even tho we've been fighting all this time, to put technology in people's hands, there's another battle of who has control of what people have access TO."<br />
<strong><br />
Since we haven't heard much about policy from the federal level, does this mean that we should approach it from state level?</strong></p>
<p>Milton - It's useful to start small, from the ground level, working within what's already in place, but then transforming it into something more feasible for the communities we serve.</p>
<p>Richard - Unfortunately, changes in the federal administration has totally changed the federal government's priorities.  "We're setting ourselves up - other countries are investing in their infrastructure (China, India) to build up their capacity to compete with the US...but we're not doing the same to compete with them."   But there are some pending federal bills in Congress about providing country-wide broadband access.  We need to get a bill together to prevent "e-poverty."</p>
<p><strong>What are the resources to give users the training to do their own IT support?</strong></p>
<p>Susan - Buy computers with warranties, get anti-virus software or tap into youth "geek squads." </p>
<p>During their closing remarks, Theresa said to "think holistically in what you're doing and how you translate" and also to get out and vote.  Milton advised we use youth as "ambassadors for change,"  to build more of a sense of trust and to get technology information to youth.   As a wrap-up, Gail asked us to "aim high" because it's easier to think about the digital divide as an achievement that will "be done."  Finally, Susan said the one thing she's learned is "that if you work together, a lot is possible...it takes checking your ego at the door...the people on the ground are willing to partner but the administration is not."  She also said to "think asset based" - to not focus on negative violence statistics, but rather positive community assets such as buying power.</p>
<p><strong>Panel 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Zach Goldstein  - Common Impact</li>
<li>Lanice O'Bryant  - BirthName Productions</li>
<li>David Pearson - Shawmut Education, Inc.</li>
<li>Thaddeus Miles  - MassIMPACT</li>
</ul>
<p>Richard started this second panel with a question around what made the speakers passionate about connecting communities with technology.</p>
<p>Zach gave his perspective on the work of Common Impact through a story of success of an afterschool program in Roxbury of only 3 staff to serve youth struggling in school with only a $250k budget.  Their challenge was processing evaluation data of their programs and track the progress of their students.  They were matched with Fidelity employees who built a database that compiled trends and reports.  Because of these reports, they were able to raise an additional $30K to develop new programs for some alumni that were falling through the cracks.  He's passionate about Common Impact revolves around his discomfort as a software developer for a big company, working just for profit.  He said his motivation is "being able to take my professional skills, knowing technology, and being able to give back to the community."</p>
<p>Lanice made the unique decision to reach out to young girls as she developed her how film company, .  "[With each girl], I believe that she has the ability to do anything that she puts her mind to.  I can bring out the beautiful aspects of these girls, but it really all starts with trust."</p>
<p>David related his passion to head Shawmut Education by asking "how can you impact a life [with technology] and then make impact on a broader community?" </p>
<p>Thaddeus spoke to the mission of MassIMPACT to create partnerships and bring people together.  But that mission hard, especially with separately run housing developments, to get people to work together as a entity on the issues around connecting the disconnected.  Right now the challenge is now not just putting the technology in the hands of the community, but working with them to relate the work they do every day to empower their members.  Thaddeus said, "It's still US putting the communities' stories on the web, instead of them sharing them themselves.  The drive still comes from MassIMPACT, rather than coming from the community organizations themselves."</p>
<p><strong>How do we keep youth engaged with the technology?  How do we continue to get the youth to apply themselves and open up about their issues/concerns?</strong></p>
<p>Lanice said her first lesson learned running her program with girls is that "the technology HAS to work."  Using a local school's technology center that hadn't been upgraded let to frustration on the part of the participants and facilitators.  She also focused her curriculum on the learning styles of the girls of color, by using techniques of show and tell, avoiding a leader led style, and providing incentives such as food and public transportation passes.  </p>
<p>She also said, after years of working with girls, she knows how to size them up after the first couple sessions.  But she advised that you have to realize that youth in these programs are usually self selected - they have to be self motivated to choose to be in these types of programs, after long school days and MCAS study.  But her staff continue to follow-up after every session to keep the girls engaged, through phone calls to parents and the youth themselves.  In order to help girls finish their pieces, she said "I have to let my ego go, and get [the girls] to the finished project."</p>
<p><strong>What are the challenges internationally vs. domestically?</strong></p>
<p>When David tried to implement a technology project in Jamaica, he quickly saw the challenges of recruiting youth for technology projects where parents are afraid to send them to school and youth would rather be out in the sun outside.  "I always try to balance what I'm trying to do and understand the culture."  He also said his staff often decides to fix technology issues themselves, rather than finding other people to troubleshoot.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Where do we find a happy medium between controlling what youth are viewing/doing on the Internet and still providing a safe, but interesting space for youth to use technology?</strong></p>
<p>Thaddeus  - Addressing this problem has a lot to do with the comfort and skill level of the instructors and staff of technology centers.  By just blocking or telling youth to get off sites like My Space or taking a more instructor led stance, it works in an immediate sense but not over time.  Also, without other outside partnerships, the tech centers are limiting themselves of what they can know. As far as the youth, "It's about meeting youth where they're at...being to explore by guided exploration.  We don't ask the youth enough what kind of programs they want."  It takes getting kids involved in the process initially of creating a technology center, if they can participate in the planning, it will help alleviate the adults fears around internet safety.</p>
<p><strong><br />
How do we address the need for long term instruction in the tech centers?  Are there training or resources available?</strong></p>
<p>Thaddeus advised looking more into the Computer Clubhouse project-based model and aiming to really engage youth as leaders and actual staff trainers.<br />
<strong><br />
How do we get parents more involved?</strong></p>
<p>Even though they recruit youth participants through the O'Bryant School or the Technology Goes Home programs, they really work hard at leaving messages and communicating with the girls and their families.  They establish some value to participating by emphasizing that "your daughter is worth my time."  You also have to approach working with the adults differently than you would with the youth.</p>
<p><strong>What are the next steps for this movement?</strong></p>
<p>Not only do we need to push for federal legislation, we also need to get more larger corporations involved and make this an issue around "public good and not just private good." </p>
<p>Antonio said we need to do more around educating community members, particularly housing residents and parents, to be more aware of the technology tools they already have (such as internet on cell phones and Sidekicks).    The youth are very aware, and their parents have to keep up to understand the relevance in daily life.</p>
<p>Open Air Boston is running training (available as vignettes on the Timothy Smith Network's site) called "Breaking the Code" around how to text message and use MySpace for parents and adults in order, as part of a larger initiative to educate people around the value of the Internet.  Technology centers can take this resource to teach their constituents how to use the internet to do every day tasks.</p>
<p><strong>In the end, attendees agreed that the Connect the Disconnected initiative needs to keep the conversation going, whether it's online (website, blog, email listserv?) or in person, and take the conversations into the community and have the members participate in the discussion.</strong></p>

				<p>We have received a small grant from Humanities Washington to go out to all the small town museums in our area. We are going to show them how to digitize their collections and place them on the INMP website. Also if they do not have a website of their own we will help them to create a basic website to help promote their museum. Finally we are going to create a 3 to 5 minute film of the project. I'm excited and ready to start.</p>

<p><strong>Don't immediately take on new responsibilities</strong> - Your workplan and job description are designed to be a 40 hour a week committment.  Your year of service will often start of slow though and many VISTAs will take on additonal commitments ("Sure I can help answer the phones").  These commitments may later hinder your ability to complete your primary duties--and may not be capacity building.  Take the time to learn about your organization and plan, you'll be swamped soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>Take advantage of your "outsider" status</strong> - Most VISTAs are a fresh face at their organization and bring considerable outside experience.  If you see something that can be improved, try to help.</p>
<p><strong>Frame what you're doing</strong> - VISTAs are not "interns" or "work study students", and most people think of "volunteers" as part-timers with minimal responsibilities (VISTA even calls you "members" not volunteers).  Let other staff know that you are consulting and are there with a specific contract that you must complete in the time allocated (your workplan).  Don't sell yourself short.</p>
<p><strong>Take advantage of your VISTA Leader</strong> - The VISTA Leaders are your #1, go to person for everything related to your VISTA service: successes, problems, questions.  You probably won't see them face-to-face, but call them or send them an email.  That's their job (err... service).</p>

	    <p><strong>Find a doctor!! </strong> Seriously folks, I can't stress it enough.  If you relocated for your project like I did, or even if not and you don't have a GP or a family doctor, find one you can go to should the need arise.  <a href="http://americorps.sevencorners.com" title="http://americorps.sevencorners.com">http://americorps.sevencorners.com</a> has a search tool (Provider Network link on the left navigation menu) that makes the process relatively simple, provided there are providers in your area. Always, ALWAYS call to double check any information listed...as I have found out - the hard way - is not always correct.  Had I found a doctor when I got to San Diego, I wouldn't have spent 4 hours in a hospital for an ear infection, gone on a wild goose chase in search of an urgent care center that would accept our benefits (resulting in my going to said hospital), wasted precious gas, and saved myself tremendous amounts of frustration.  (You can read about it <a href="http://ctcvista.org/node/359" title="here">here </a>or <a href="http://ctcvista.org/node/362" title="here">here</a> if you're interested in details.)  But really, remember to eat, sleep, and take care of yourself so you don't have to see a doctor at all!</p>

				<p>Hey everyone,<br />
Thought I would update for the summer.  At the Egleston Square YMCA we are having a camp for the after school program children.  I am offering a Creative Writing curriculum that I wrote myself for about 6-10 kids; I included digital storytelling.  Basically this curriculum lets the kids explore different ways of telling a story.  We will write poetry, short stories, fiction or non-fiction, since they are kind of young the short stories will be more like picture books.  Then we will do the digital stories.  I am thinking about just having the while group do one digital story because it might be a little too much for each person to do their own.  What do you think? </p>
<p>Also, for the school age kids i will start a math club.  I have been collecting math resources and websites in our delicious website. I have a lot of colorful math games to do and work sheets.</p>
<p>For the Teen Center I am providing a 6 week Media Literacy workshop called Media Minds, established through the YWCA.  </p>
<p>The Open Access at the computer lab is getting a slow start, but there is one lady that comes in who wants to have computer lessons, so i teach her Excel and basic computer skills.<br />
So, lots of educational goodness and fun is happening this summer!</p>

				<p>Recently I've been working on improving how the CTC VISTA Project stores its files, and thus, how we maintain a memory of what we've done irrespective of who did it.  For VISTAs, that's crucial because we're, by definition, here today and gone tomorrow (or a year from today).</p>
<p>To begin, I'm working on implementing a central file-server where we can house all of our documents, both archived and current.  We're using the University's Apple XServe and I'm working to make sure that everyone at HQ has a login and just as important, <em>knows how to connect and use it</em>.</p>
<p>In the past, all of our documents have been stored on our local machines and flung at eachother as email attachments.  Recently we've been using Google Documents because its collaborative editing makes versioning a breeze (ever tried to merge changes from five different people), but since we're all using our personal Google accounts and sharing documents, I'm scared at what happens when the document creator leaves the VISTA Project.  I've played around with Google for Domains, but for most of us, editing with a desktop application, like Microsoft Office or Open Office, is easiest.  Workflow optimization is key, and if we're distributing these documents as files, importing and exporting from Google can become a major headache.</p>
<p>I originally got the idea for this from the <a href="http://www.benton.org/?q=publibrary">Benton Foundation</a>'s <a href="http://www.benton.org/publibrary/stratcom/techlit.pdf">Technology Literacy Benchmarks for Nonprofits</a>.</p>

				<p><img src="http://communitymedia.typepad.com/criticalfocuslogologo1026.jpg" alt="Critical Focus logo" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5" />Check out my appearance on a panel about changing the media on Cambridge's cable access station, <a href="http://www.cctvcambridge.org/">CCTV</a> <a href="http://communitymedia.typepad.com/critical_focus/episode_6_changing_the_media/index.html">Critical Focus</a> show.  As it says on their blog, "Critical Focus: A Forum on Media Today is a series of six one-hour videos investigating how representations in the media affect culture, politics, and behavior. Each episode features a diverse panel of experts from academia, journalism, the broadcast industry, and social action agencies assessing the impact of media on our society."  This episode focused on discussing some concrete ways citizens can learn about and change the media landscape.  Of course, I plugged both the CTC VISTA Project and MassIMPACT's work doing digital storytelling with housing developments in the Boston area.  I felt pretty privileged to sit next to <a href="http://communitymedia.typepad.com/critical_focus/2007/03/possible_guests.html">fellow panelists</a> like Nettrice Gaskins, Lauren-Glenn Davitian, and Steve Provizer, who've been working on community media, technology, and activism for YEARS, and have folks interested in what I had to add.</p>

				<p>The Washington Post got a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Bell">world-famous violinist</a> to play (unannounced) in a DC metro station to see what would happen. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/04/AR2007040401721.html">What happened was this</a>: of the 1097 people who passed by during the almost-hour of his performance, only a few stopped to listen for a moment. The violinist did receive $32.17 in tips, which isn't too bad, but still much less than one would expect for a Grammy- and Oscar-winning musician.</p>
<p>So, nonprofit organizations aren't the only ones that have trouble getting people to pay attention even if they are doing amazing work. Our work needs associated communication and the proper context, too.</p>

				<p>Wondering what fellow VISTA Jessica McCoy and I have been collaborating on since September? Check out the launch of a new online project, <a href="http://www.storiesforchange.net">StoriesForChange.net</a>, sponsored by both of our host organizations!
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.storiesforchange.net" title="StoriesForChange.net"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/206/520054523_feb5cf510a.jpg" width="279" height="91" alt="Stories For Change Logo" /></a></p>
<p>We're excited to announce the launch of the online social networking portal for community digital storytelling, <a href="http://www.storiesforchange.net">StoriesForChange.net</a>.  This site is sponsored by <a href="http://www.massimpact.org">MassIMPACT</a>, in collaboration with the <a href="http://storycenter.org">Center for Digital Storytelling</a>, to provide a meeting and sharing space for those interested in using digital storytelling for community advocacy or grassroots social change.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most exciting reasons to check out <a href="http://www.storiesforchange.net">StoriesForChange.net</a> (SFC):</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>NETWORK with other facilitators online anytime: </strong>SFC gives you a chance to meet others who are doing similar work in communities and post questions to the group in the Forums, without having to wait for a yearly conference.</li>
<li><strong>DISTRIBUTE your stories online in a trusted place: </strong>We've put particular attention into the &quot;meta data&quot; or accompanying information that goes with digital stories shared on the site.   Your posted stories not only have context, but they can be Creative Commons licensed so you can control how stories are used.</li>
<li><strong>Tap into a new LIBRARY of stories: </strong>Most facilitators show at least one or two digital stories at the beginning of every digital storytelling workshop. SFC intends to become a great library of user contributed stories to help share examples across communities, cultures, languages, and contexts.</li>
<li><strong>Add your RESOURCES, share your experience:</strong> Check out the Share Your Resource option, which allows you to share experience around the creation of stories in various community settings.</li>
<li><strong>Post your EVENTS to reach a wider audience: </strong>Post your upcoming workshops, screenings, and meetings, so others who are geographically close to you can attend.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to get involved with <a href="http://www.storiesforchange.net">StoriesForChange.net</a> is to signup for a membership on the site and start sharing stories and resources, as well as posting events. We're also hoping to start some great discussions in the Forums section &lt; <a href="http://storiesforchange.net/forums">http://storiesforchange.net/forums</a> &gt;, especially in the topic &quot;Get Involved with SFC Site Development&quot; &lt; <a href="http://storiesforchange.net/forum/603">http://storiesforchange.net/forum/603</a> &gt;.</p>
<p>Major funding for building the site was provided by MassIMPACT, which along with the Center for Digital Storytelling and Creative Narrations also supported the first annual Gathering of Community Digital Storytelling (see blog at <a href="http://communitydigitalstorytellers.blogspot.com">http://communitydigitalstorytellers.blogspot.com</a>) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in June 2006.  The site was ably built by developers at Float Left and Vernal.</p>

				<p>Just wanted to let everyone know (or at least everyone who reads this blog) that there is a new resource available for VISTAs! Matt Isaacs and I have started an irc channel at Freenode.</p>
<p>To use this channel, you'll need to have an IRC client. Xchat is probably the most popular program for linux, but there is also a Windows client that might be fruitful. iChat seems to be the mac equivalent (any guidance on that point would be useful).</p>
<p>For more details, check out <a href="http://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml">http://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml</a>. That URL will take you to the Freenode site, which will link you to popular clients, information about how to configure them, etc.</p>
<p>Once you have it set up and ready to roll, be sure and join the #ctcvista channel!</p>

			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p> With my idea set I began to plan how I would accomplish my teaching. I started writing up a detailed lesson plan. Mapping out hour by hour each weeks activities. I realized early on I would need to include the history of graphic design, but I only had about an hour of space to do it. This was blocking point for me for awhile. I set about creating charts and posters and other means to instill a knowledge of the evolution of graphic design. I gathered images and texts from many books and websites. Soon I realized that in the next week the class would begin.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/217/512371268_fdd6493fd3.jpg" alt="Graphic Design Workshop Examples" title="Graphic Design Workshop Examples" hspace="10" vspace="14" width="500" height="375" align="middle" /></p>
<p> So what happened the first day of class. Not much. After having visited multiple schools, getting info from over 50 kids and making call backs,  2 youth showed up. I was a little heart broken. It had been decided that on the first Thursday of the workshop I would give a brief talk to all the you who participate in the 3 different programs on Thursdays. So as I said earlier I had spent weeks preparing every minute detail. What did I do when it came time to give my talk. I through out all my plans. I simply decided to have a conversation with the you about graphic design and let them decide where we would go with it. This to me seemed much more in the spirit of the workshop anyways, to give the reigns over to the youth and simply act as a moderator. It worked, I was amazing, every kid participated. Some as usual were the main talkers but eventually everyone found a point at which they had a question or an answer. We talked about history of art, advertising, corporate identities and logos, t-shirts, shoes, cell phones, and on and on. Eventually we had to cut the talk off because it was past time to get to work.</p>
<p> I learned a lot from giving this talk. I learned that with youth you must create an environment which they can engage. You can engage them if you want, but that is what happens the rest of the day. Teachers assigning them work, parents setting rules, and companies selling them junk. And they love to learn as long as it doesn&#39;t seem like work. </p>

				<p>When I first started at PCTV I was introduced to a number of very broad and ominous projects that I was to be filling my time with. Of course these project overlapped the skills I had acquired in school to some degree, but plenty of them fell outside of my knowledge. </p>
<p>One of these large projects was to create a new visual identity for PCTV. In the past things had been made as they came up and were not quite coherent. This of course was well within my skill set, having graduated with a degree in graphic design. Without realizing it I was jumping into the real world of graphic design. For those who are not a part of this cult like group of artists who don&#39;t make art, there is a major difference between what happens in academic design and what is made for the real world. In academic design things happen, they don&#39;t get made. Concepts, images, colors, typefaces are all great but if they are not put together to make a real thing which serves a real purpose they become convoluted quickly.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/221/512371280_129dae0ea3.jpg" alt="My desk at PCTV" title="My desk at PCTV" hspace="10" vspace="14" width="500" height="375" /> </p>
<p>Enough about this academic / real world clash. I found myself trying to design the identity for an organization which has existed for 14 years and currently has 5 programs running. PCTV does everything in media with everyone. Worst of all the make media with youth. Youth are not an easy target, of course if you selling them shoes or something it is a different game. So how could I make PCTV attractive to youth, eureka, I will simply gather some youth to do it for me. That is how I decided to start a Graphic Design workshop at PCTV. My hope was that in exchange for teaching the youth about graphic design, I could get out of them designs which would speak to their peers. When I say this to myself sometimes I feel like a villain tricking some kids into my scheme, but my intentions are good I assure you.</p>

</ul></h2>

				<p>Did anyone get to watch 60 minutes last night? They had a report on Nicholas Negroponte and his involvement with One Laptop Per Child, a non-profit organization that is trying to bring affordable $100 laptops for all the underserved children in developing nations.</p>
<p>The report was very eye-opening for me. I had heard of the project but didn&#39;t give it much thought. However, after the interview I came away disappointed with Negroponte and his organization. I believe his intentions are good, but his lack of business skills and toxic relationship with the tech industry will inevitably doom his efforts to bring laptops to children.</p>
<p>Apparently, Intel has developed a cheaper and better laptop, but somehow Negroponte is angry about it because he thinks Intel is getting in the way of his mission. Intel&#39;s computer called &quot;the Classmate&quot; is much like the laptop developed by Negroponte&#39;s One Laptop Per Child organization as it  is specifically engineered to fit the needs of the underserved children of developing nations. </p>
<p>Negroponte is upset with Intel because he thinks the Classmate will put him out of business; and instead of trying to partner with Intel, Negroponte has chosen to react with unwarranted hostility. Clearly, bringing laptops to the BILLIONS of children in developing nations can&#39;t be done by any single organization, yet Negroponte seems to think that One Laptop Per Child is the only organization that can do it. </p>
<p>It is this type of this do-it-alone-because-I-am-the-only-one-fit-to-do-so-because-I-care-more-about-people-than-you-do approach that will cause his organization to fail. Negroponte may be a good guy, but he needs to realize that he must cooperate with the tech industry and other non-profits if he wants to be successful. Also, he should realize that a little competition is a good thing, and reacting negatively to competition is harmful.</p>
<p>Finally, Negroponte, One Laptop Per Child, and others need to figure out how these laptops can specifically improve the lives of folks living in developing nations. 60 minutes did say the kids were more likely to go to school, but they didnt say exactly what the kids were doing while at school with their laptops. Playing games, taking pictures, and horsing around is ok so long as it doesnt take away from the curriculum. Perhaps instead of feuding with Intel, Negroponte should work on developing a curriculum that invovles these laptops that is an improvement on what came before. Giving these kids a nice toy is surely generous, but giving them a laptop in tandem with curriculum enhancements would be even better.</p>

<p>Three quotes:  </p>
<ol>
<li> &quot;Service is the rent we pay for living.  Service is the rent we pay for living&quot; - Hubie E. Jones quoting someone else I didn&#39;t catch</li>
<li>&quot;I typically tend to feel isolated.  SO MANY PEOPLE must feel this way, and because of this, we used our AmeriCorps VISTA service to build a solution.  MeetAmeriCorps.org connects current and former AmeriCorps members - talk - let someone feel your pain.  And your joy!&quot; - Colleen, (CTC VISTA and genius at using her loneliness for social change)</li>
<li>&quot; Whales and pizza end poverty.&quot; </li>

				<p>I’ve been swamped of late, as Wilderness was scrambling to test and refurbish all kinds of machines over these past couple months.  We just completed a huge rollout of 110 or so Pentium 4 computers to 11 new WildTech member schools.  Held the big seminar this past Friday.  Absolute chaos all ‘round, but somehow, we came through for the better.  This in spite of very low donor input for the quarter resulting in a severe shortage of essential parts like RAM and hard drives.  </p>
<p>And we couldn’t have done it this week without support of volunteers old and new all year long.  An old friend dropped in last month looking to check in on things since he left for a job a year ago; while a new part-timer signed on from an all-too-familiar place.  The former, younger man is merely a geek-at-large.  The latter gentleman is a software developer who worked with Mac computers.  Both are eager to help when and where they can.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone by these two, the quarterlies from Bellevue have also done well.  They come to receive credit from the man I call “sensei,” Mr. Rudolph Helm. My former instructor sent a profoundly deaf young man unto us.  You might be wondering if, in a business with a lot of beeps and blips, such a man can do the work expected.  He can, and more.  This young man also has an uncanny sense of humor (and some very animated interpreters) to carry him through.  Everybody has potential, but it takes a very special person to recognize that potential and set it into motion; so as Rudy had done for me, he did the same for the deaf man.  This humanism, I think, is what makes him a powerful teacher and mentor, and one whose style I would like to draw upon someday.</p>
<p>As always, Wilderness has been a great organization to work with.  I’ve been through a lot with them in these three years I have served.  Students and volunteers come and go, but I have remained.  From 2004 to present day, I’ve been watching over the Wilderness without fail, rising with the sun and never fading; I work until nightfall to ensure that the company’s customers are served well and with the very best equipment and education that it can give them.  But in the process, I wonder, is three years enough?  Or perhaps too much?  Either way, I will not be renewing my Vista commitment, so that another man may take this opportunity to serve.  As I see it, there are a number of things I’ve learned while serving, and as many paths now open to me—many more than before I signed on.  I could go back to school and become a teacher, or test the open job market, or even start my own business with the skills I’ve refined here.   I’d love to stay for another year, but my feelings tell me I must move on; that I have accomplished my mission here; and that continuing further with WTA would do more harm than good.  Though I face an uncertain future, I am not one to shy away from it.</p>

			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p>As I sit here looking at my things to do and my calendar I&#39;ve realized that its just just about six months into my VISTA -ship already. Wow, times really flown. There certainly have been a lot of obstacles that my organization has been facing in the six months I have been here including funding, moving locations, and a few other internal matters. We&#39;ve still been working through things and doing what we can do though. I&#39;ve been doing my share in helping to write out certain areas of our strategic plan mainly focusing on ways to implement better community involvment and awareness in the technology/broadband policy debate. I also wrote a letter of inquiry for grant not too long ago but haven&#39;t heard anything about that so far. Right now I&#39;m also organizing our &quot;Meet the Funder&quot; event that will provide community organizations to hear from grantmakers, get the scope of the grantmaking and grantwriting process and just ask general questions on the grant proccess. </p>
<p>All in all its been an interesting six months. Great nontheless. I&#39;ve really learned a lot about  the non-prof world.  </p>
