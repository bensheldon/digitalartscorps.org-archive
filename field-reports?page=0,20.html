				<p>I am getting settled into my project site. I was lucky enough to be familiar with the site in advance. I'm learning my way around and have done some research on resources that I may be able to use which I found very helpful. I wish to say thanks to all of you who have sent me links on resources we may be able to use and links to volunteer services. They are coming in handy.</p>
<p><strong>Things I will be working on this week are:</strong><br />
     Researching the types of software we will need to make our computers accessible.<br />
     Researching which companies might be willing to either donate or reduce the cost of this software for non - profit organizations.<br />
     Organizing and scheduling committee meeting for new committee members.<br />
     Locating volunteers.<br />
     Setting up training on how to use the various features of MS Office/Small business. (I may have lost my volunteer for that and need to locate another)<br />
     Setting up a employee handbook on basic "computer 101" to cover how to perform updates, disk cleanup, defragmenting ect.</p>
<p><strong>So far what has been accomplished in between research is:</strong><br />
     Located and had donated the use of a conference room for our TechACCESS workshops.<br />
     Received a donation of refreshments for the trainings.<br />
     Learned how to use MS Excel to perform a mail merge (that was actually fun).<br />
     Sent out a bulk mailing to inform the community about our project and invite the community to the workshops about accessibility (way more stressfull than it should have been)</p>
<p>I found a software program that I am going to attempt to have donated to us called SuperNova. It is one software that is accessible for any person with any level of sight impairment. Obtaining this will mean we will not have to purchase several different programs.</p>

	    <p>Nice to see YES keeping you busy already. Rayna do you have a link to Supernova or be willing to post it to the Wiki? Also posting about some of the research you're doing this week to the Wiki would be really helpful. A lot of people are working on assistive technology and it's an entirely new area for the CTC VISTA Project so any/all information or tools you find would very useful. The Assistive Tech portion of the Wiki is <a href="http://www.ctcvista.org/access_inclusion" title="http://www.ctcvista.org/access_inclusion">http://www.ctcvista.org/access_inclusion</a>. just log in and start adding.</p>

	    <p>Looks like you have a full plate, but it's exciting to see you've made some good progress.  How did you manage to get the food donations?  When I used to work in-kinds, I found that often, all you have to do is ask.  If only grant-writing worked that way :-)</p>
<p>That <a href="http://www.yourdolphin.com/productdetail.asp?id=1">SuperNova</a> program looks really neat.  I just checked on <a href="http://techsoup.com">Techsoup.com</a> (the place for donated software) and they don't even have a Accessibility category.  Good luck!</p>

	    <p>It helped with the food donations that I had an inside connection with the owners of the store :) Not always that easy though. What I have done is made a master letter that can be changed to suit whatever we are asking to have donated. It explains who we are what we are doing and asks for what we need. The what we need part can be changed to cover what we want it to. I attach a business card and proof that we are non - profit along with an explanation of why we need the donation. I just used it successfully again to receive another donation for fund raising purposes. It is rough to get anything donated here as the town is so small so I often go to the larger cities or towns nearby. I will post it on the wiki for anyone who is interested.</p>

It's a project I've been working on pretty much since the beginning of this VISTA year, by meeting with folks from the Lower Roxbury Empowerment Coalition, a group of housing developments and non-profit programs who are trying to create inter-neighborhood partnerships and tap into Northeastern University outreach programs.  Jayme Bonds, who works tirelessly at Mandela Homes, participated in one of my train-the-trainers this spring and got pretty adamant about me working with youth leaders from her summer programs.  We decided to open it up to as many local housing development summer programs as we could get together, and it worked out well.  We even got a couple participants from Worcester!  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ctcvistaqueen/725855967/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1050/725855967_c1f6bbaa99_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Group (with D)" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></a>I gathered some MassIMPACT folks and got Colleen Kelly, now former CTC VISTA and employee at Emerson College, to come help facilitate.  The group of youth were all girls except for one, well spoken young man George, who all had interesting and personal stories to share.  It was a big group for a digital storytelling workshop (over 15 folks working on stories at once) but it worked out fine to split the group into two story circles and we had enough experienced storytellers floating around to help with the one-on-one support.  Several of the youth also really excelled at the technical side, so they were finished with their stories by the beginning of the third day.  So we had them publish their stories on StoriesForChange.net and help build the Google Map...and then show others how to do it as well.  We're hoping to do a few follow-up two-hour workshops over the summer to help support these youth in their quest to teach digital storytelling to other younger residents.</p>
<p>I also owe big thanks to Royal and Paulette at Camfield Estates for hosting, and for Jayme Bonds from Mandela Homes for providing the food.  The final stories are posted at StoriesforChange.net <a href="http://storiesforchange.net/event/teen_digital_storymapping_bootcamp" title="http://storiesforchange.net/event/teen_digital_storymapping_bootcamp">http://storiesforchange.net/event/teen_digital_storymapping_bootcamp</a> and all linked off the Google Map at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=101507654869685312962.00000113773a71cb7665b&amp;z=10&amp;om=1" title="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=101507654869685312962.00000113773a71cb7665b&amp;z=10&amp;om=1">http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=1015076548696853...</a><br />

				<p>Under two weeks working at the Grand Rapids Community Media Center and things have been busy.  I am jumping in and helping out with a summer program that is already in existence called ArtWorks.  I ride around in a production van filled with high school kids and equipment, and we have been filming interviews at the Urban Institiute for Contemporary Arts, to make a project for their capitol campaign.  So far so good, they need my help and I am glad to give it.  I have contacted local youth GLBT groups and explained that I want to teach the kids how to create their own digital stories.  I have had good responses but it looks like things won't start until the school year.  I am making my own digital story this week and will spend some time trying to figure out the best way to exhibit it.  Meanwhile, I am working with inner city kids on a new project.  They are 16-19 year old males who have are on the fence between jail and a job.  We plan to teach them video basics; production, planning, how to do an interview, how to use equipment, etc.  The challenge here is forming a relationship with them, gaining their trust, finding common ground to start from.  It will take time, and I am working with amazing people who luckily have been doing this for a while.   I know that this year I will constantly be learning, and I am really excited about that.  My supervisor is awesome, and we get along great.  My organization is broke, and financial support for a conference is out of the question...boo.  Happy 4th to all...</p>

	    <p>Sounds like a lot of fun driving around in the Van.  Mobile operations are always better than sitting around the office (take it from me, I don't even have windows).  </p>
<p>I used to work with <a href="http://dkrawc.com">Danielle Krawczyk</a>, who started the MOLLIE Project at Grand Rapids many years ago as a CTC VISTA.  He posted a great <a href="http://dkrawc.com/node/103">video</a> about it.  </p>
<p>Also, I hope you are talking with <a href="http://ctcvista.org/user/1039">Danielle Martin</a>, who has more digital storytelling experience than you can shake a stick at.</p>

	    <p>Hey Sarah,</p>
<p>Oh man I can't wait to see your story!  Is it the same one from the GRUT workshop? Let me know if you need any feedback on your script and such.  You're going to post it StoriesforChange.net right?  And you could also connect with Jessica McCoy, a current CTC VISTA at the Center for Digital Storytelling who actually helped Naomi out with the story we showed at the PSO.</p>
<p>You should take a look at this great event that I'm going to post soon about this ds workshop a friend of mine is doing in Africa around getting women to share their stories around violence (a different but still sensitive subject, especially down there).</p>
<p>Say hi to Richard!</p>

				<p>I feel really lucky to be at Venice Arts.  In the past week, I've been offered an awesome room 1 block from the beach, a bike to borrow, lots of free thai food, and an amazing house-sit for the Venice Arts director.  Last week was a lot of introductions and getting familiar with the classes we offer and the type of tech services I need to offer.  Joanne clarified with me that my role is not going to be actually creating a website.  I am going to be more of an online mentor.  She says I will be the "tom from myspace" of our site: Beyond Myspace.  So I will have a page on the site where I will spotlight certain students artwork each week/month, make comments on all the artwork on the site.  Then I will be putting together a policy committee for the site, as well as training all the students and artist mentors on how to use the site.  So basically I will be the administrator of Beyond Myspace.  I still hope to refresh my web design skills and learn more php within everything else.<br />
In addition to this, I am co-mentoring the Arts Discovery class for the 5-7 year old kids.  I co-mentored my first class on Saturday.  We got acquainted with the kids and made masks.  Their attention spans are short as is typically the case for young kids, so we are thinkinng of ways to keep them entertained and engaged for the entire hour and a half.  During the week, I will be around offering technical assistance for the other classes as well.  Everyone at V.A. has been really awesome and I'm so happy to be here.</p>

Sounds like you've got some cool work ahead of you as a moderator.  There are actually whole conferences dedicated to online community managers, moderators, organizers etc. - there was one recently here:</p>

	    <p>You should also connect with <a href="http://ctcvista.org/reports/user/968">Jessica McCoy</a>, the current CTC VISTA at the Center for Digital Storytelling who is acting as the current "Editor" for the new site, <a href="http://storiesforchange.net" title="http://storiesforchange.net">http://storiesforchange.net</a>.  We're working with adults, but trying to do the same thing around building an online social network.  We just went through a process of creating a <a href="http://storiesforchange.net/forum/site_help/sfc_submissions_policy_and_guidelines">submission policy</a> with a committee of volunteers...man was that a challenge.</p>
<p>You should also check out Project Think Different <a href="http://www.projectthinkdifferent.org/" title="http://www.projectthinkdifferent.org/">http://www.projectthinkdifferent.org/</a> and Cara Powers <a href="mailto:cara@projectthinkdifferent.org">cara@projectthinkdifferent.org</a> (former CTC VISTA).  They created a "music socially conscious MySpace" last year and I'm not sure how it's going but she'd probably have lots of experience to share.</p>
<p>Oh and I Delicious'd <a href="http://del.icio.us/ctcvista" title="http://del.icio.us/ctcvista">http://del.icio.us/ctcvista</a> this article about myBloc.net <a href="http://www.wiretapmag.org/arts/43103/" title="http://www.wiretapmag.org/arts/43103/">http://www.wiretapmag.org/arts/43103/</a>.  </p>
<p>I'm REALLY interested to keep reading how this project goes.  I might be leaving the Project, but I'm going to grad school and I'm interested on how to social networking tools to get youth more active as community organizers.</p>

	    <p>Hey Angela,<br />
I recently met with an Online Community Organizer for YouthNoise - they have a brilliant platform called My Cause Is - it allows youth to tap in to the power of sharing media that they make to raise awareness and ACT on causes - allowing youth to  develop and implement a campaign for social change among peers in a safe online environment - awesome. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.youthnoise.com/page.php?page_id=2712" title="http://www.youthnoise.com/page.php?page_id=2712">http://www.youthnoise.com/page.php?page_id=2712</a></p>
<p>Anyway, I could put you in contact with the Manager if you'd like to chat with her.  Contact me off board and I can introduce you...</p>

				<p>For those of you who wear glasses: this spring I got two pairs of prescription eyeglasses (including the lenses) for $8 and $12 from <a href="http://zennioptical.com/cart/home.php">zennioptical.com</a>. My old glasses have broken several times and while I've been able to repair them with superglue so far, I know they won't last forever. The glasses from Zenni Optical aren't the nicest glasses you'll ever buy, but they're great as backup glasses, prescription sunglasses (+$4.95 for the tint), or "my bank account has $50" glasses.</p>
<p>To buy prescription glasses online, you need to have your prescription (duh) including your "pupillary distance." You can get your prescription from your eye doctor who you got your last pair of glasses from, but you'll probably have to specifically ask for them to include the pupillary distance; as far as I know they avoid giving it out because it allows you to go elsewhere for prescriptions (but it's part of your prescription, and yours to know). At Zenni Optical, they don't require a copy of the prescription, you just enter it in yourself.</p>
<p>I have a few pictures of my new glasses <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/becw/tags/glasses/">tagged "glasses" in my flickr account</a>.</p>

<p>Updating organizations sounds pretty tedious; too bad to teach you have to do.  I hope you're learning a lot though about the process and probably the problems as well.  Do you have any ideas yet on how you're going to create a training manual for it?</p>

				<p>whoooo hoo.   Just got done teaching my digital storytelling class.   At Media Bridges, we have a series of youth classes lasting a week or two.  Mine lasted one week, 3 hours a day.  And the ages were 9 - 15.  You would think that the 15 year old would have been bothered by the younger ones, but they all got along really well.</p>
<p>At first I was worried because I didn't think we would get done in time.  But the opposite happened - most of them were done before.  And of course these kids love to play on the internet.  Games games games and videos on you tube and their myspace pages.  So advanced and so little in the attention span department.  One kid continually preferred to watch remix videos of happy feet, spongebob, and dora to music like ' party like a rock star'  gggeeez.  </p>
<p>Anyways.  I didn't have much in the means of curriculum.  I have found that kids in this age range don't pay attention to hand outs or class instruction.  What worked well was me going around to each group (singles and doubles) and explain the steps as they approach them.  Some needed more attention then others and it all balanced out pretty well.  </p>
<p>Before the class started, I scoured through most of the material out there about the topic.  All of it was useful information, but nothing was quite tailered to a youth class outside of school.  I also kinda dreaded pulling personal stories out of these kids.  Originally I was going to have them bring personal items from home like photos, toys, etc and make a digital story about themselves.  BUT - the education coordinator here had a great idea- a field trip!  I highly suggest this approach if you are working with a group of kids in a short amount of time.  </p>
<p>We took a trip to the Contemporary Art Center in Cincinnati, just a few blocks away.  They have a great children's floor called the UnMuseum, filled with interactive art.  So we all went on Monday with video cameras that could also take photos (though I can see now, that the quality is not so great on video).  They had two hours to play, explore and take pictures and even  some video too.  Before sending them off, I told them what I was looking for: a picture of their favorite piece, least favorite, the coolest part, and if you would come back again.  And guess what?  Only a few of them remembered to include these things on their own, while I had to remind some others, and some still did not include those parts. </p>
<p>I wanted to avoid the whole bit about pointing out unneccessary things like:  "this is a crazy room"  "this is a chalkboard".  But I still got that.  It's a challange to get some kids to talk more in depth about the pictures they took and how they feel about it.  Everytime I asked them how they feeeeel about something, I felt rather cheesy and almost like a therapist. </p>
<p>So here are some logistics if anyone tries this in the future:<br />
- 10 kids (that was our maximum)<br />
-  5 computers (MACS) + the instructer's computer was also used<br />
- 5 cameras (they shared, and that worked out!)<br />
-  I imported the pictures and the videos to save time<br />
- used iPhoto to edit and adjust pictures<br />
- iMovie<br />
- on the 2nd day, I put all the pictures and all the videos on everyone's computer, then they worked at that computer all week.<br />
- used our radio room to record the voice overs (kinda a luxury, any mic on a computer will do)<br />
- when some kids were finished early, and if interested, I let them make their own music using Soundtrack, a companion to Final Cut.  It's a loop based program that's easier than Garageband (i think)<br />
- and voila!  we had the screening party today</p>
<p>At first I tried to keep them off the internet.  Especially the younger, less focused kids.  They all have myspace pages and love the branded games of the disney channel.  But by the third day, seeing how quickly they worked through, I gave in.  It's not ideal.  But at least it kept them occupied while the other kids were working.  Also, those were also the kids that had those frickin roller shoes.  Any moment I was not looking, a few would leave their computers and skate around every where.   these crazy kids with their crazy shoes.  </p>
<p>In the end, the class turned out quite well.  They all finished their stories - 5 total.  I'll post those up soon.  I can't watch their videos right now, I've seen them too many times already.  I am happy to say that some of them are really good and definitely qualified as well thought out digital stories.  </p>
<p>Now it's off to prepare for next month's week long class- Ad Attack!  (that exclamation point is part of the title).</p>

	    <p>You ROCK! Sounds awesome and thanks for all the juicy details in your post.  You could publish the stories on StoriesForChange.net and Jess &amp; I would be psyched!  And if you add it as an Event, you can see all the stories together...see the workshop I just did in Roxbury with youth <a href="http://storiesforchange.net/event/teen_digital_storymapping_bootcamp" title="http://storiesforchange.net/event/teen_digital_storymapping_bootcamp">http://storiesforchange.net/event/teen_digital_storymapping_bootcamp</a></p>
<p>I'm of the tack that any story kid take this gumption to finish is GREAT!</p>
<p>For Ad Attack, see if you can get your hands on MNN's media literacy curriculum...it's awesome.  I have a paper one I could send you if you can't get it online.</p>

				<p>The PSO is finished. Deep Breath. Exhale. </p>
<p>On to the exciting portion of the VISTA year! Many from June's PSO started at their organizations Monday and some will begin shortly. Already heard good things coming from Rayna at YES in MA, Kelli at The United Way in NC, and Rian at the Davis Community Network in CA. Sounds like people have really hit the ground running.</p>
<p>Here at HQ, we're catching up on filing and sorting all the PSO paperwork, updating some Website odds and ends, following up with everyone, and still recovering from the PSO. </p>
<p>Things to look for: The CTC*VISTA Wiki has a front page that now links to the new Working Groups categories. Check it out at: <a href="http://ctcvista.org/wiki" title="http://ctcvista.org/wiki">http://ctcvista.org/wiki</a> . I'm heading up the Volunteer Management working group and also the Business/Marketing working group. I've been adding/re-organizing the Volunteer Management section the last 2 days. Check it here: <a href="http://ctcvista.org/node/609" title="http://ctcvista.org/node/609">http://ctcvista.org/node/609</a></p>
<p>I'll be checking in mid-week next week with all the East Coast VISTA's to see how things are going after the first week and a half. Talk to you folks soon!</p>

				<p>I am back in the office this morning after taking a couple days off from the successful completion of last week's PSO.  Boston has been baking under 90-plus degree weather and it's actually comforting to be back in the air-conditioned cave that is  UMass Boston.</p>
<p>Despite the completion of activities from the PSO,  there is still a lot of paperwork to process, evaluations to read and improvements to be documented down for next time.  We've ran four PSOs in the last year,  which has kept  the process fresh  in the Project's mind.  Fortunately for our stress-levels, our next full-PSO won't happen until next summer; unfortunately, that leaves a lot of time to forget what we've learned unless we document it.</p>
<p>Even with the Lowell PSO  over, there are a few more VISTAs that will be joining us in  August.  They will be attending the Corporation's PSO in Providence, RI, which is gentler since the Project won't be running it, but we'll still have to orient them to all the CTC VISTA specific info and procedures.  All of the paperwork for those incoming VISTAs is due next week!</p>

				<p>I know a lot of u are tired of reading all of my posts since I do em so often (every 3months-lol) but here I am. Since last time I've gotten a much better handle on web site building though I still have much to learn. I finished the company site a few weeks ago and are just waiting for the go-ahead to publish it to the web.  I've mostly been gearing up for the summer where we'll start to have regular classes with students. This is where I'll be getting all my footage and interviews from which to post on our site and future Kiosk  network. The Kiosk network will consist of free access computer terminals listing a directory of community resources for ppl without computers or internet access at home). I really enjoy the whole planning and strategical process involved with these plans. How uber exciting!</p>

We're gearing up to do some new strategic planning at CTC VISTA HQ and I'd be interested to know who you were working with and what process/tools you used.

	    <p>The planning process went about as smooth as can be expected. We're aiming to work with as many local organizations with community involvement as possible. I've gone to a few community workshops sponsored by "Capacity Builders" and collected a lot of business cards. The basis of the website was Microsoft Frontpage (after giving up on Dreamweaver-lol). The Kiosk was started with Frontpage but finished in a lesser know program called Web Easy. I was trying to find the absolute easiest program to train new students with. As far as the learning, that's an ongoing process. Web design is a whole other art form that takes a lot of time an effort to learn it's true foundation.</p>

				<p>I returned from Lowell and hit the deck running early Monday. The highlight of the day was visiting the present computer lab and evaluating its relocation to the former County Jail site. This new site proved to be pretty well wired for power and well wired for cat 5 with  a present capacity for 24 PC's punched down to the IDF. The IDF rack has expandability to 48 nodes.</p>
<p>The rack will need switch/routing. Work on T1installation is in progress, mostly funded by E-rate, Tele-connect fund!</p>

	    <p>Yes, several other community outreach programs are on board as we grow out and cut out bars and open access in the very real sense. Such as the "CREW" -youth at risk doing heavy lifting projects, a farming area, and accross the street the recreation department(softball and soccer is in the pipe). We believe the Ojai Land Conservatory, and numerous Social Services are inbound. Senior meals on wheels fleet which is out growning its base, and many other possibilities.</p>

	    <p>Thanks, Danielle.  Great photos, particularly the one showing the river and the hydro power project and the dorm through the chain link fence on the bridge <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=627672346&amp;size=o" title="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=627672346&amp;size=o">http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=627672346&amp;size=o</a> .</p>

				<p>The first day of CTC VISTA I learned a lot of information about what the project is about.  It was nice to see all the different people coming from all over the U.S who work in the same field with diverse background.  I look forward to the many network I can find and built.  I want to be able to built up my social skills as well as learn more about technology, especially in digital media.  Hopefully I'll get to learn more as time past on. =)</p>

				<p>Boston ROCKS!  Well, Lowell anyways.  I haven't seen any of Boston except from the interstate.  But Lowell?  Well, last night we crashed the Brewery Exchange.  Fun times.  Tomorrow night we'll go back for Bull Riding.  Tonight we're hoping for karaoke, pool and drunken darts at the PITA bartender.  Savage, I know, but this is Boston and apparently all bartenders are required to be rude here.</p>
<p>This morning I woke on the 16th floor to a squeaky bed and bright lights, feeling the burn for my two greatest needs:  caffeine &amp; nicotine.  I thought briefly of stealing my roommate's lighter, but he's a black man from D.C. and I had no interest in finding out what sort of retribution he might deliver for such an affront.  Instead I went wandering through the streets.  At 7 am.  For a lighter and coffee.</p>
<p>So this girl beside me thinks she looks like a monkey without shaving her legs.  I'm not sure how to tell her that's ridiculous, but I suppose this'll work.  She looks nothing like a monkey.  A lizard, perhaps....</p>
<p>Heh.  Gonzo journalism at it's finest.  Hunter, eatcher heart out.</p>

				<p>Greetings from the CTC*VISTA PSO at UMass Lowell. It is a lovely week here in Massachusetts. Hopefully the West-coasters are pleasantly surprised. </p>
<p>I think this is a great communications tool, and very usable, which will probably make me more eager to post. I'm excited that so many of us will be in the Boston area. That makes it even easier to communicate!</p>

				<p>Today was the 1st day of PSO.  Mostly, we had meetings and filled out paperwork.  It was nice to discover that not everyone was right out of college.      A few of us had several years of work under our belts.   Even my roommate had years of experience in teaching and photojournalism.</p>
<p>Digressing a bit, it certainly is warm and humid.  It made for a sleepless night last night since there was no air conditioning.  It gets warm in eastern Washington state, but the humidity there is in the teens rather than the eighties.  I also have air conditioning at home.</p>
