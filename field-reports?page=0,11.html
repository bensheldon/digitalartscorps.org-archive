				<p>I'm not really sure what to put up since I feel all written out. I've stopped writing my PCM blog for the last several weeks because I've been so busy, but before that I was posting once a week. I also just finished researching and writing a grant proposal (literature review included) that we're hoping to submit to the Knight Foundation. I also made a dummy website as a visualization for it (in other words, I don't know how to use WYSIWYGs, so I laid it out in InDesign). We're hoping to target both the immigrant population and young people, the two fastest growing demographics in Portland. Not to mention that while everywhere else in the US baby boomers are the majority, Gen Y is the majority here.<br />
What have I done in the last couple of months (can this field report count as two entries? :D)... I've gone to:
<ul>
<li>Portland Zine Symposium</li>
<li>Portland Grassroots Media Camp</li>
</ul>
</p><p>I unexpectedly helped out with a digital storytelling class (which I had never done) that was a partnership between Progressive Communicators Network, PCM and the Center for Digital Storytelling. I took a digital storytelling class about a month after and have discovered the frustrations of anchor points in Final Cut. I'm currently taking a field class in shooting/production and a class in multimedia digital storytelling (read: Flash and Photoshop)...<br />
I taught my first class last Tuesday called "Distribution Beyond Borders." It was a class focused on personal branding using social media tools to draw people to self-produced creative content. It was really fun to teach, and I got Secret Aardvark Hot Sauce as a present for having taught my first class. :)<br />
Overall, though, things at work are slowing down now that I've finished writing the grant proposal. It's not dragging at all, but I guess I'm feeling paranoid about the possibility in the future. I guess now is a good time to learn CSS and Drupal...<br />

Connie, the hostess, put some lipstick on the pig.<br />
I got to see thousands of <a href="http://www.audubonportland.org/local-birding/swiftwatch/swift-watch" title="Portland Audobon Society">swifts fly into the Chapman School</a> chimney in mid-September. The Chapman School in NW Portland is one of the biggest swift congregation points on the West Coast as they migrate for the winter.<br />
I went on a <a href="http://pcmtv.org/?q=node/213">disastrous backpacking trip</a> (my first) in which I ended up with huge welts on my hip. One disappeared while the other turned blackish-brown and is still on my right hip more than a month following.<br />
I went to <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWestern_College_Program&amp;ei=LbPqSImsC5KEsAOB2LSLCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE5XyZyaRzLzQ_XTcBs1joFYq_NFg&amp;sig2=ZrNP5U8xfLDvHtKgpIDR1Q" title=" Western College Program">my college</a>'s 35th reunion; every 5 years they have a huge reunion from the first graduating class of my college.<br />
I've also decided recently that I really enjoy roasted garlic and I like Joe Biden. My thoughts on the vp debate: Probably the majority of immigrants can identify with Joe Biden better than Sarah Palin when it comes to self-broadcasted image. Palin is constantly talking about "Joe Six-Pack" (slightly offensive) and "Hockey Moms," which may appeal to the middle class, but a very specific middle class: the general white middle class. I think most immigrants who come to the States are looking for a better future and educational opportunities for their kids. That's an everybody-value. In my parents' case, they worked toward getting American degrees so they would have that threshold credential to do as well as they could for themselves. However, becoming a hockey mom, a soccer mom, a band parent, &amp;c. organized sports and such aren't necessarily something immigrants value or would think to expose their kids to. So in terms of relating to one image or another, I personally relate more to Joe Biden and not because I'm rich (clearly, none of us are right now). I suspect that to some groups of people, Joe Biden and the rest of those politicians from low-income, middle-income backgrounds radiate the "I made it" vibe. For me, personally, I think the only thing Joe Biden was broadcasting about himself in the debates was critical thought and reflection. Sarah Palin pandered more to a specific group by selling a specific image.<br />

<p>They are all very gushy, affectionate words, of course :) Hope you had fun! I haven't been to Oxford yet since moving to Cincinnati, but I do like it there. It kind of reminds me of what Athens might be like if Athens were slightly less awesome...</p>

	    <p>I totally thought about it, too. I was in OTR, and I walked by Media Bridges!! I peered in, thinking maybe on an off-chance I'd see you working furiously at your desk as the last slivers of sunlight faded into the evening (poetic, no?). Of course, it was also a Sunday.<br />
Unfortunately, I hardly had anytime to see anyone. I think my one friend is still pretty pissed at me; due to certain traveling mishaps (my other friend drove us all the way to Indiana in her attempt to get back to Oxford from Dayton Airport), I didn't have time to see her.<br />
And I'm sure Athens is a thousand times cooler. Walmart, Qdoba, Coldstones, popped collars, J. Crew, paisely purses... not very original anymore, that Oxford...</p>

				<p>Month 2 of working at Aspiration has been a lot more comfortable.  Getting used to all of the things that I had to work with during the first month made everything seem new and crazy.  But, now that I'm used to working with all the software, the people and the mission, it's been nice.  Aspiration is getting ready for our second annual Nonprofit Development Summit in November.  It's basically an event to bring people concerned with nonprofit software together in one place to hash it out.  A lot of organizations are supporting us by giving us money, like Google, or facilitating discussions/presentations (like Drupal and Joomla).  Right now we're still in the early stages but part of my job has been talking to people in the nonprofit industry (especially people on the west coast) and check out their interest in the Summit and whether or not they would like to present or lead a discussion.  That's pretty low-key at the moment but I'm sure once the end of October/beginning of November hits, it's gonna be like a cat in a dryer.  </p>
<p>At the same time, I am working on a couple of websites for the organization.  First, there is a wiki that I'm putting together for the Summit and second, we are putting together a Joomla!-based website for a new aspect of our organization called Answr.net (it will be another resource for nonprofits).  I don't know much about Joomla so i've been learning as I go which I love.  It's fun to just figure stuff out on your own, you know?  But then you run into a brick wall and curse the day you burned your "So You Want to Learn Joomla!" book....</p>
<p>So, i've been splitting up my time talking to people, fleshing out wikis, playing around with Joomla and keeping the balls rollin here at Aspiration.</p>
<p>Speaking of Joomla, a couple weekends ago I went to Joomla! Day at Google in Mountain View.  Joomla Day is a chance for people to get together and discuss Joomla with lead developers and also just general users.  I was there as a "Joombie" because i had never used Joomla before.  The only thing i knew about it was that my boss has a lot of Joomla swag.  Regardless it was super interesting and Google was a fun to run around in.  Everything is free which is a little unnerving.  I walked in and there was this vending machine with Naked juice but it didn't take any money.  It just opened.  Free Naked juice.  weird.  That stuff is usually like $3 a pop.  The cafeteria was completely open too.  Free salads, entrees, Ben and Jerry's, cappuccino...  Also, the toilets had remote controls!  but I won't get into that unless you ask me.  </p>
<p>Oh, and I got business cards which are pretty sweet.  I give them out to anyone that will take them.  I think that's all for me.  Garcia out.</p>

<p>I don't know how much you know about Drupal, but how would you characterize the usability of Drupal vs. Joomla? I know very little about Joomla but I've always wanted to mess around with it when I get the chance.<br />

	    <p>Hey Josh,</p>
<p>My experience with Drupal is very low (but I'm going to Drupal Camp this Saturday so that might change soon...) but the popular comparison is that Joomla is more user-friendly but at the same time more basic.  But only slightly so.  </p>
<p>The Drupal vs. Joomla conversation came up a lot at Joomla Day but the vast majority of people said that it was really a tossup and a matter of different "flavors."  Some of the lead developers at Joomla day also do development work for Drupal and they would always say that "eh..... it depends...."  So maybe i'll have a better answer for you after this weekend (since one day in Drupal camp will impart onto me years worth of experience.  obviously).</p>

				<p>After spending next to a month scratching my head over switching our org's database to Salesforce, we've decided (thankfully) that it might be more trouble than it is worth. Luckily I have the Organizers' Database at my fingertips which seems to take care of most everything that I need without the massive headache that Salesforce proved to be.<br />
Today I just started our first email campaign with constant contact. I can't tell you how much easier it is.<br />
We've got a pretty full month coming up with two exhibitions and a pretty kick-ass lineup of music, workshops, and even a volunteer awareness night. I'm really looking forward to the 'zine show...<br />
Other than that- things are great. It's getting a little chilly (okay- it's pretty cold) but the leaves are all turning beautiful colors so I'm just hoping I'll survive the winter without crying like a little girl.<br />
Wish me luck:)</p>

				<p>Well, things have been interesting here, to say the least. The non-profit I work for is in the middle of restructuring its relationship with the radio station whose license it owns, but which is operated by the volunteers at the station. We lost our Station Manager over the controversy that led to the restructuring so I have been working out of the radio station so as to help answer phones, get mail, put us back on the air when we fall off for whatever reason etc. This has put me in an awkward position which I won't go in to in any detail, but it has also given me the opportunity to learn more about how radio works and how stations operate: everything from receiving the satellite feed for Democracy Now and getting it on the air to testing microphones for a phone interview which accidentally went live on air (and yes, I was singing "hello"!).</p>
<p>Aside from being on air more and working with Cool Edit Pro and recording equipment particular to our station, I have been cultivating a group of volunteers to get them involved with the station and the Journalism Project. I had to kind of restart this process after the drama occurred between the station and the non-profit.</p>
<p>I have also been working on a few grants in partnership with other non-profits in the area. These relationships are promising as they are mostly directed towards youth, some "youth at risk," to build media literacy curriculum and get them civically engaged. I also will be beginning training sessions at a public housing development here on how to use Audacity. </p>
<p>I have been building relationships with a few oral history projects in Asheville that are telling stories about urban renewal, immigration, and over development in our area. I want these groups and their work to be heard on our station, but because of the politics involved with the non-profit and the station at the moment, I don't know exactly how this will all unfold. </p>
<p>On other notes, I have been training at a place called URTV, a public access tv station where I am learning how to use video cameras and editing programs. Coming up I will be taking a special seminar on preproduction preparation from a woman who is a well known documentary film maker (sorry, I don't have her name). </p>
<p>Also, I just returned from Hickory, NC where I was at a festival for Black Mountain College. If you are interested in art, poetry, and innovative educational philosophies, you should check out <a href="http://www.bmcproject.org/" title="http://www.bmcproject.org/">http://www.bmcproject.org/</a>. I was there audio recording the event and doing interviews with contemporary poets and historians. It was pretty amazing.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I am trying to "do what I do," as they say, and where all of this will land, I don't have total control over.</p>
<p>Peace,</p>
<p>Abigail</p>

<p>So this past month was pretty tedious and slow.  As some of you may or may not know, I am currently migrating my org's current website into a new, Drupal-based web 2.0 friendly site.  There were nearly 1500 pages from the old site to import,<br />
and much of the (great) content on the old site also remained buried beneath many, many pages - there were no RSS feeds on anything, no bookmarking services built in, and no browsable tag clouds - basic characteristics of web 2.0 sites.</p>
<p>Luckily, most of pages were were outdated and were able to be deleted.  However, there were still many tedious bits to the importing - where should they go?  How should the specific pieces of content be categorized?  Was there a space for them on the new site?  What would those new spaces looks like?  How can the content be easy to find?  Do all the links on this page still work???</p>
<p>My goal was to make the content as easy to browse and share as possible, increase it's <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/ambientfindability">ambient findability</a> .<br />
<strong><br />
Overview of Modules Used</strong><br />
Central modules that I used on the site included Views, Panels and Taxonomy Node Operations - all three of these made for some fun and challenging work.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/taxonomy_node_operations">Taxonomy Node Operations</a></em>:<br />
This was a very helpful module.  When i imported all of the content from the old site (which took about a week of tweaking to get just right - i was getting all sorts of odd characters and HTML showing up in posts) none of it was categorized.  What this module does, is allow a 'mass categorization' of content from the content administration page in Drupal.  I of course had to go in and create the categories first, but once done, categorizing the content was easy.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a></em>:<br />
Views I used in order to create 'landing pages' for particular areas of the site (which were defined by the kinds of content appearing in each).  For instance, there is a section of the site called '<a href="http://namac.org/drupal/capacity-building">Capacity Building</a>'  Capacity Building is a service that we offer and on the page that had info about this service(s), i wanted to have all articles having to do with 'fundraising' (synonymous with capacity building) appear there as well.  So, all articles on the site which had to do with 'fundraising' I tagged/categorized as such and viola!  they now appear on the landing page of our 'Capacity Building' section.  I used this technique throughout the site for various sections...</p>
<p><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/panels">Panels</a></em>:<br />
This is  great module for configuring how you want a page to display.  It's a bit like putting Drupal blocks and Views into specified sections (panels) of a page.  The front page and the '<a href="http://namac.org/drupal/policy-and-advocacy">Policy and Advocacy Network</a>' pages are both Panels.</p>
<p>I also started playing around the general look and feel of the site through a hacked Drupal theme (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/SEOposition">SEO Position</a>).</p>

	    <p>Nice rework of the site. The new layout feels a lot more intuitive. Views is probably the most useful module I've found. It's incredible but can be daunting to try to use off the bat. I've got to learn how to use Panels. Any good tips for someone unfamiliar with it?</p>

	    <p>Hey Thanks Kevin,<br />
Hmm.  With Panels, it's really helpful for layout of a site.  It's nice for working with blocks (which as you know, are pretty limited on where they can be placed on the Drupal page).  What's superpowerful though is when you combine the Views modules ability to render content in a block and feed that is as a 'block' on a panel.  </p>
<p>For instance, these two pages:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.namac.org/drupal" title="http://www.namac.org/drupal">http://www.namac.org/drupal</a> (the front page, which is actually  a panel)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.namac.org/drupal/idea-exchange" title="http://www.namac.org/drupal/idea-exchange">http://www.namac.org/drupal/idea-exchange</a></p>
<p>Use a custom View - the same one in fact - the View (rendered as a block) brings up 10 random posts of the 'Article' content type as a list.  This is the 'Articles From Our Members section' you see on each page, though on the front page I limited I to 5.</p>
<p>I included the screenshots from the admin interface so you can compare.  Note that each is a 'two column stacked' style of panel, meaning one section at the top and one section at the bottom of two columns side by side.</p>
<p>Idea Exchange Panel:<br />
<a title="IdeaExchangepanel.png" href="http://s29.photobucket.com/albums/c268/memeshift/scraps/?action=view&amp;current=IdeaExchangepanel.png"><img src="http://i29.photobucket.com/albums/c268/memeshift/scraps/IdeaExchangepanel.png" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Home Page Panel:<br />
<a title="HomePagepanel.png" href="http://s29.photobucket.com/albums/c268/memeshift/scraps/?action=view&amp;current=HomePagepanel.png"><img src="http://i29.photobucket.com/albums/c268/memeshift/scraps/HomePagepanel.png" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Hope these make sense.  Hit me up if you wanna play with them anymore.</p>
<p>Does Ben use Views or Panels on this site?  I'd love to see the module list.</p>

Hello There VISTAs,
</div>
<div align="justify">
</div>
</p><p>
As a special BONUS Field Report, I decided to write about some money management tools/tips I came across recently.  As a VISTA, money can be tight.  If mismanaged, then money can be REALLY tight.   If you're like me, than you were probably used to subsisting at a certain standard of living before becoming a VISTA (or not).  You're suddenly having to figure out other ways to get to work, find the best deals on food and sacrifice things you thought you'd never live without. Having to reorganize your spending and budgeting habits can be pretty stressful.
</p>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<div align="justify">
However, the transition in to VISTAhood doesn't have to be as traumatic or hard on you financially, provided that you use your new found poverty (or stable paycheck!) as an opportunity to develop a strong spending and budgeting regimen.
</div>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<div align="justify">
In this field report, I'll give a brief overview of an automated <em>Monthly Budget Calculator</em> (attached at the end of this report) I'll also share with you the awesomeness of <em>stress-free bank account automation</em> - a nice little series of hacks to take the stress out of paying your monthly bills, build your savings and STILL have a little left over for that *Deluxe* bowl of Top Ramen.
</div>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<div align="justify"></div>
<p><br /></p>
<div align="justify">
<strong>Understanding Your Budget</strong>
</div>
<div align="justify">
Part of staying stress free during times of financial hardship is having a clear understanding of your financial obligations and limitations.  It's also nice to know where you might a have a little more 'wiggle room' for those enticing moments (or unexpected expenses) that inevitably come along the way during these times.<br />
Included at the end of this report is a *Monthly Budget Calculator.  You will notice 4 columns in it: Income, Fixed Expenses, Variable Expenses and Totals.
</div>
<div align="justify">
<strong><em>Income</em></strong>:<br />
In this column, there are two sub columns.  One is simply for labeling your income source(s) - my hope is that you take this calculator with you where ever you may go.  I've conveniently entered in 'AmeriCorps Stipend' for you as well as the monthly income ($800) for a VISTA serving in San Diego - this may be different dependent on the city and state you are serving in.  You can change the $800 amount to fit what ever yours is.
</div>
<div align="justify">
<strong><em>Fixed Expense</em>s</strong>:<br />
Here is where you will list each of your fixed expenses and other monthly bills, like 'Rent', 'Savings', and 'Cell phone'.  I've entered in some 'filler' numbers for these - change to fit your situation.
</div>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<div align="justify">
<strong><em>Variable Expenses</em></strong>:<br />
These are expenses that can vary by month.  Food is sometimes the most variable of these which can be either a good thing or bad thing (do let your supervisor or VISTA Leader know if you are running low on food - they're there to help and there are plenty of resources out there).  Transportation is another one, like if you decide to bike to work one day instead of taking the bus or you end up carpooling.  I usually try to round this up a bit, just in case - any extra left over can either go to my savings or for some extra 'discretionary income' (see below).
</div>
<div align="justify">
<strong><em>Totals</em></strong>:<br />
Here is where all the magic happens.  If you've been changing the numbers around in the other parts of the spreadsheet, you may have noticed that the numbers here change AUTOMATICALLY to reflect the changes you've made.  Immediately, you can see where your money is going, the total of your expenditures as well as any 'Discretionary Income' you may have left over.  This is income you can use as you wish: a visit to the book store,  the movies or maybe even partially back in to your savings - savings are after all, an investment in your future.<br />
Now that you've got a tool and framework for understanding what your monthly budget is, where your expenses are going and even how much 'extra' money you have available, the next step is to ensure that the right money goes to the right places and that you can do this all on time  -  without stressing.
</div>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<div align="justify">
Think you can't do it?  Read on.
</div>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<div align="justify">
<strong>Getting Bills Paid On Time = Less Stress = Happy VISTA</strong>
</div>
<div align="justify">
A major cause of financial stress is bills.  Well, not necessarily the bills them selves, but having to PAY them - especially if there is some unexpected expense that comes up during your VISTA year.  While you can't do away with these completely,  there are a few things you can do to be in strong financial standing.
</div>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<div align="justify">
<strong><em>Hack Your Bank: Automating Multiple Checking Accounts are Key to Avoiding Financial Stress</em></strong>
</div>
<div align="justify">
An oft over-loooked fact about most checking accounts is that you can set up <em>automatic withdrawals and deposits</em>.  You can divide and disperse deposits made to your bank account across multiple checking/savings accounts, pay bills to specific utilities automatically and even mail checks - all by specific dates.  All of these can be further set up to occur on regular, repeating dates (which works nicely as your AmeriCorps stipend also occurs on a regular, repeating date - hint, hint).
</div>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<div align="justify">
You can also set up <em>multiple accounts</em> to work in concert with your saving, checking and bill paying automation.  When you first got  your bank account, you most likely got a checking account and savings account.   Referring back to our Monthly Budget Calculator tool, you can also set up another checking account for 'Fixed Expenses' - think of it as your specific 'bill paying' account.  Used in conjunction with the automatic check dispersement of your VISTA Stipend deposit mentioned above, automatic bill payment from this new account takes the hassle out of writing and mailing a check or paying over the phone close to the time your bill is due. Just be sure the monthly amount in this account matches what you came up with previously in your Budget Calculator.
</div>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<div align="justify">
Setting all this up is usually free, takes just a few minutes and can work wonders for reducing stress.<br />
All this so you can enjoy the finer things in life, like whether to get 'Oriental' flavor Top Ramen or 'Deluxe Oriental' flavor Top Ramen.

				<p>Here are the actual quotes from this guy all I did was copy and paste notice how it is in all caps i recieved it as I he was shouting and trying to prove a point like a teenage "GURL"</p>
<p>Since I am creating timelines I have enough literature for a whole book if I keep at it so pretty soon you all will be reading my book. (lol) For real thats the new plan I have to get something out of this experience and I want this information to be public.</p>
<p>"THANKS FOR THE APOLOGY, THOUGH I REALIZE THAT THE PHONE AND INTERNET ARE A CHALLENGE AT THE MOMENT.  WHEN THE EMAIL IS STRAIGHTENED OUT THAT MAY BE THE BEST WAY TO COMMUNICATE SINCE WE SEE EACH OTHER SO LITTLE. "</p>
<p>" I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU LOOK AT ME AS SOMEONE WHO IS "TRIPPING" AND WATCHING YOUR EVERY MOVE.  I'LL JUST SAY THAT I HAVE NO TIME TO WATCH THE EVERY MOVE OF YOU OR ANY OF OUR PAST VISTA'S.  MY CONCERN WAS THAT I HAD INVITED YOU TO BREAKFAST FRIDAY AND I THOUGHT YOU'D ACCEPTED, BUT I DID NOT GET A REPLY TO MY EMAILS OF MONDAY OR THURSDAY AFTERNOON.  NOR COULD I CALL YOU, THOUGH I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAD TO LIMIT INCOMING CALLS FOR FINANCIAL REASONS."  </p>
<p>"I WAS SOMEWHAT SLIGHTED THAT YOU SKIPPED OUR BREAKFAST WITHOUT COMMUNICATING WITH ME, BUT I BECAME TRULY CONCERNED WHEN I WAS UNABLE TO FIND YOU AT COLLINS CENTER AND WAS INFORMED THAT YOU HAD NOT BEEN IN ALL WEEK (AND HAD NOT CALLED OR EMAILED EITHER).  I LATER LEARNED FROM DIEGO THAT YOU WERE NOT AT YE-TEC EITHER THAT FRIDAY, A WORKDAY. </p>
<p>PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT VISTA IS NOT A WORK STUDY PROGRAM BUT A FULL-TIME SERVICE COMMITMENT, AND YOUR CONTINUED RECEIPT OF FEDERAL BENEFITS -- LITTLE AS THEY ARE -- IS DEPENDENT ON MEETING THE TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT WITH CTC VISTA.  COLLINS CENTER IS OBLIGATED TO ENSURE THAT VISTA'S SERVE A FULL-TIME SCHEDULE, AND I HAD AGREED TO BE YOUR INTERIM SUPERVISOR WHILE DONNA WAS AWAY. </p>
<p>FOR YOUR INFORMATION, I RESPONDED EXACTLY THE SAME WAY WITH VICTORIA ONE DAY LAST FALL WHEN SHE COULD NOT BE FOUND AT COLLINS CENTER OR REACHED BY PHONE OR EMAIL.  IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE HAD GONE ON AN OUT-OF-STATE VACATION BUT HAD FORGOTTEN TO REMIND DONNA OR ME (WE HAD APPROVED A VACATION A MONTH EARLIER), AND SHE HAD NOT PUT THE VACATION ON THE COLLINS CENTER CALENDAR.  SHOWING UP TO WORK EACH DAY, STAYING THROUGH THE FULL WORK DAY, AND REPORTING ANY VARIATIONS IN THE SCHEDULE TO YOUR SUPERVISOR (AND TO EVELYN AT COLLINS CENTER) ARE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROJECT AND ARE NOT SOMETHING SINGLED OUT FOR ANY ONE PERSON."</p>
<p>"I'M VERY SORRY THAT YOU AND VICTORIA HAVE GOTTEN OFF TO A DIFFICULT START.  I WILL COMMUNICATE YOUR REQUEST TO VICTORIA IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T DONE SO DIRECTLY, BUT IF YOU TWO CAN'T WORK IT OUT I PREFER TO LEAVE THE RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER TO YOUR SUPERVISOR.  DONNA HAS BEEN VICTORIA'S CO-SUPERVISOR AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THE ISSUES BETWEEN YOU AND VICTORIA.  IF I AM NEEDED FOR ANY REASON, DONNA WILL LET ME KNOW.  TO THE EXTENT THAT EITHER OF YOU EXERCISED UNPROFESSIONAL DEMEANOR, WHETHER INTENTIONAL OR INADVERTENT, I WOULD HOPE THAT APOLOGY(IES) WILL ENSUE.  (IN MY EXPERIENCE, A PROCEDURE FOR RESOLVING SITUATIONS LIKE THIS IS FOR THE SUPERVISOR TO HOLD A MEETING WHERE EACH PERSON DISCUSSED THEIR POINT OF VIEW TO THE OTHER, BUT I LEAVE IT TO DONNA TO DECIDE WHETHER TO DO THAT OR NOT.)"</p>
<p>"I AM SORRY YOU THINK THAT IS THE OPINION OF YOUR SUPERVISORS; IT IS NOT.  EXCEPT FOR THE THURSDAY BEFORE LAST I HAVE VIRTUALLY NO DIRECT INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE, OR NOT DONE, SO THAT QUOTE COULD NOT POSSIBLY REFLECT MY OPINION OF A MONTH OF SERVICE.  THE ONLY "DRAMA" ON MY PART WAS LAST FRIDAY WHEN I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR TEMPORARILY SUPERVISING YOU AND DISCOVERED YOU WERE NOT REPORTING TO WORK, AND THAT IS HARDLY "UNNECESSARY" -- IT IS THE ESSENCE OF A SUPERVISOR'S RESPONSIBILITY.  </p>
<p>IN MY VIEW, THE ADJUSTMENT PERIOD FOR A NEW VISTA REQUIRES THAT WE ALLOW TIME FOR YOU TO GET FAMILIAR WITH THE PROJECT AND THEN SET PERSONAL OBJECTIVES THAT ARE REALISTIC FOR YOUR SKILLS, INTERESTS, AND THE PROJECT'S GOALS.  UNTIL THAT POINT -- WHICH APPARENTLY YOU'VE NOW REACHED -- IT IS INEVITABLE THAT THERE WILL BE SOME MOMENTS OF INDECISION AND LACK OF FOCUSED PROGRESS, AS WAS TRUE WITH BOTH PAST VISTA'S.  I THINK THAT THE FIRST MONTH'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE NOT EASILY MEASURABLE; WHAT COUNTS IS WHAT A VISTA DOES OVER THE ENTIRE COURSE OF THEIR YEAR OF SERVICE."<br />
"NO, YOU ARE ONLY SERVING AS THE CO-OP VISTA.  THE OTHER POSITION WAS TO WORK ON POLICY AND RESEARCH ISSUES WITH MYSELF AND A PARTNER ORGANIZATION, UNDER DIRECTION OF THE PARTNER ORGANIZATION, AND YOU HAVE NO DUTIES IN THIS AREA.  TO THE CONTRARY, YOUR WORK IN THE CO-OP SHOULD ACTUALLY BE ENHANCED BY THE FACT THAT VICTORIA WAS RETAINED -- SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT PLANNED AT THE TIME OF RECRUITMENT -- AND IS ABLE TO SPEND SOME PART OF HER TIME ASSISTING WITH THE CO-OP PROJECT.  THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE LESS TO DO; IT MEANS YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH MORE IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT WORKING IN ISOLATION.  IT WILL BE YOUR AND DONNA'S DECISION AS TO WHAT YOUR WORKPLAN WILL BE, AND WHETHER YOU AND VICTORIA WORK JOINTLY OR SIMPLY COORDINATE ACTIVITIES."<br />
"  DONNA CAN DISCUSS THIS WITH YOU BUT CTC VISTA IS A NATIONAL PROGRAM WITH ITS OWN RULES; THEY ARE NOT OUR RULES THOUGH WE ARE OBLIGATED TO FOLLOW THEM.  YOUR POSITION IS FULL-TIME AND PAYS HEALTH, TRAINING, AND A STIPEND FOR COMPLETION IN ADDITION TO THE POVERTY-LEVEL WAGES.  TO MY KNOWLEDGE OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT IS NOT PERMITTED BY CTC VISTA, BUT IN ANY EVENT THE MINIMUM WORK WEEK IS STANDARD FOR ALL VISTA'S NATIONWIDE.  </p>
<p>YOU ARE WELCOME BUT IN NO WAY OBLIGATED TO WORK HOURS BEYOND THE MINIMUM CTC VISTA SERVICE COMMITMENT.  IF YOU HAVE AN EVENING OR WEEKEND WORK EVENT, YOU ARE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR SUPERVISOR AND WITH EVELYN AT THE COLLINS CENTER TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO YOUR NORMAL SCHEDULE.  THERE IS FLEXIBILITY SO LONG AS YOU COMMUNICATE IN A TIMELY WAY, BUT I LEAVE ALL QUESTIONS OF YOUR VISTA SCHEDULE AND WORK TO YOUR SUPERVISOR."<br />
" GOOD QUESTION, SINCE I DON'T SEE WHY THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DRAMA AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU ASSOCIATE ME WITH "ALL OF THIS PRESSURE".  </p>
<p>IT SEEMED TO ME THAT YOU WERE ALREADY FEELING PRESSURE THE FIRST TIME I MET YOU, THE DAY WE WENT TO LUNCH, AND I TRIED TO SUGGEST WAYS TO ALLEVIATE MONEY PRESSURES.  IT WAS HARDLY MY INTENT TO ADD PRESSURE WHEN I POINTED OUT WAYS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO EXAMINE PERSONAL BUDGETS TO FIND WAYS TO ECONOMIZE.  YET DONNA TELLS ME YOU LATER BECAME UPSET WHEN I GAVE YOU THE EXAMPLE OF KEVIN, OUR FIRST VISTA, WHO PUT HIS CAR OUT OF SERVICE IN ORDER TO AVOID INSURANCE PAYMENTS AND REPAIR COSTS DURING HIS YEAR OF SERVICE.  I WANTED TO GIVE YOU TOOLS TO EXAMINE YOUR EXPENSES IN VIEW OF INCOME, AND I THOUGHT THAT BUDGETING WOULD BE A USEFUL SKILL FOR THE GRANTS AS WELL.  MY MOTIVATION WAS NOT TO PRESSURE YOU BUT TO EMPOWER YOU TO SET AND LIVE WITHIN A BUDGET; ANY DECISIONS ABOUT YOUR FINANCES ARE QUITE OBVIOUSLY YOUR OWN.  IF YOU THOUGHT MY SUGGESTIONS WERE ADDING PRESSURE THEN I APOLOGIZE FOR THE MISUNDERSTANDING BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WAS THE FARTHEST THING FROM THE INTENT.  FROM NOW ON I THINK IT BEST THAT I NOT TO ASK ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR GIVE ANY FURTHER ADVICE ABOUT YOUR INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL MATTERS.  </p>
<p>I AM ALSO PUZZLED WHY DONNA, IN HER EMAIL, SEEMED TO THINK I SIDED WITH VICTORIA IN THE DISPUTE THAT I SAW BREWING A WEEK AGO THURSDAY.  IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT VICTORIA'S EFFORT TO COORDINATE CO-OP WORK BY GIVING YOU A DAILY WORK PLAN THAT MORNING WAS COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE AND BEYOND HER ROLE.  AS YOU KNOW I PUT A STOP TO THAT IMMEDIATELY AND I MADE IT CLEAR THAT VICTORIA WAS NOT TO BE YOUR SUPERVISOR, THOUGH I TRIED TO DO SO IN A GENTLE MANNER.  BEFORE YOU STARTED WORKING I HAD ASKED VICTORIA TO HELP GIVE YOU GUIDANCE, JUST AS KEVIN HAD DONE FOR HER LAST YEAR; I THINK SHE WAS TRYING TO INVOLVE YOU IN THE CO-OP WORK IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY, AS SHE AND KEVIN HAD WORKED, BUT SHE DID SO IN A WAY THAT CAUSED PROBLEMS AND RESENTMENT FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.  I SUGGESTED TO YOU THEN, AND TO DONNA BY EMAIL, THAT LONGER-TERM INDIVIDUAL WORKPLANS WOULD BE FAR MORE APPROPRIATE AND I LEFT IT TO DONNA AND YOU TO DECIDE WHAT WAS APPROPRIATE.  I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THAT YOU DID DEVELOP A WORKPLAN AND I WILL LEAVE IT TO YOU AND DONNA TO ASSESS YOUR PROGRESS ON THAT PLAN.  </p>
<p>UNFORTUNATELY YOU AND VICTORIA SEEMED TO UPSET EACH OTHER FURTHER THE NEXT DAY, AND SOMEHOW IT SEEMED YOU LOOKED AT ME AS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DISPUTE IN SOME WAY.  AT THE SATURDAY TRAINING EVENT, I TRIED TO OPEN CONVERSATION WITH YOU DURING THE BREAK BUT IT SEEMED CLEAR THAT YOU HAD NO INTENTION OF SPEAKING WITH ME.  THOUGH YOU SAID NOTHING, I AFTERWARDS GUESSED THAT YOU MUST HAVE BEEN HOLDING ME RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISPUTE IN SOME WAY.  I AM SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY, BUT SINCE DONNA IS YOUR SUPERVISOR AND SINCE YOU AND I DON'T SEEM TO BE UNDERSTANDING OUR COMMUNICATIONS IN THE SAME WAY, I THINK IT BEST TO LEAVE THE RESOLUTION OF THOSE ISSUES TO DONNA UNLESS SHE ASKS ME TO BECOME INVOLVED.  </p>
<p>ALL IN ALL, I AM SORRY THAT YOU HAVE HAD DIFFICULTIES IN YOUR VISTA EXPERIENCE AND I HOPE THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO WORK THEM THROUGH WITH DONNA'S GUIDANCE.  MY HOPE IS THAT IT WILL SIMPLIFY YOUR WORK ENVIRONMENT, AND REDUCE YOUR MIS-PERCEPTIONS OF PRESSURE FROM ME, BY MY LEAVING ALL ISSUES OF WORK SCHEDULE AND WORK PROGRESS TO YOUR SUPERVISOR, EVEN DURING THIS PERIOD WHEN DONNA IS AWAY.  DONNA WILL BE FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO BE PRODUCTIVE AND SATISFIED WITH YOUR VISTA EXPERIENCE, AND THAT YOU SATISFY THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS OF CTC VISTA AND THE COLLINS CENTER."</p>

				<p>Treat people with "Dignity and Respect" even if you don't agree with them or like them. The golden rule is similar "Treat people the way you want to be treated"  Every see the Disney movie Bambi? "If you don't have anything nice to say then don't say any thing at all" Oh and the Bible "Do unto others as you would want other to do unto you" I keep going with the Universal quotes of how we are all suppose to respect each other but that would bore you read part two of the drama.<br />
Good Morning to all</p>
<p>I would like to inform everyone that I Loveta Wynn has been part of the digital divide for almost a week or so I have been unable to check and receive emails from my personal laptop. Apparently it has this crazy virus and it takes about 40 minutes or so to connect to the web so with all of the pop ups and warning signs it is very frustrating to sit still and wait patiently. I said all of that to say that my emails are delayed and I honestly apologize for not using other forms of communication.</p>
<p>I honestly did not think it was that big of a deal but now I see that some parties involved are tripping and watching my every move as if this was a work study program.</p>
<p>For what it is worth I am not completely satisfied with my position as a vista I have not received a written apology from Victoria Edwards for embarrassing  and insulting me at the Collins Center on Friday August 15 2008. I was offended and I want justice to be served.</p>
<p>I am deeply sadden that all of my efforts I put fourth  to in my first month of service has been overlooked and unrecognized as me “sitting here with nothing to do” from here on out I will document the entire task that I complete. (I find that strange based on the stories from the past vista’s they seem to have had little or no supervision and they were trusted and encouraged to do a good job by the end of there service.) So my next question is why is there all of this unnecessary drama going on that hasn‘t occurred before while having vista volunteers? I just remembered that I am doing work for 2 vistas so is that worth anything?<br />
So when I have down time I have to work on another project I am only getting 11,000 for the year I will do what I can because I am all about solutions and creating social change but I will not over work myself on projects for anyone. I am demanding the same respect and courtesy given to all vistas who paved the way for me to be here today.<br />
Why is there so much drama when I have only been hear for 1 month working I thought I was still feeling my way and learning the ropes. With all of this pressure it makes me unsure about my choices.</p>
<p>July 14, 2008- My first day at the Collins Center Evelyn got me all set up with my personal cubical and office supplies and email. Victoria introduced me to some professionals in the office she also had me read a book “Digital divide and social inclusion” I read the whole book. Who reads a whole book in 8 hours? I felt like I was studying for my final exam or something. I didn’t complain or show disrespect I simply did it. I thought it was over the top. But Victoria told me that Kevin made her do the same thing. Paid 12 dollars to park</p>
<p>July 15, 2008- I met with Phil Bacon I did a short interview and he gave me tips to survive to survive in the business world and how to conduct myself while being at the Collins Center (take the initiative and  give help where help is needed sort of like Victoria. Paid 10 dollars to park</p>
<p>July 16, 2008- I went to Collins Center for half the day then went over and met Diego for the first time I met his volunteer staff and I introduced myself. I also did community service I gave a volunteer a ride to a few places in the neighborhood because it was raining and because I felt like it was the right thing to do. Paid 8 dollars to park</p>
<p>July 17, 2008- I went back over to Diego’s observed the CTC and the students to get a better ideal of how I fit in. Victoria showed me where to park in Overtown it was Noon and you all know that it is absolutely hot during that time of the day. Well we were walking and Victoria got us lost so we walked in circles downtown from Overtown to the Collins Center in the hot sun. I was pouring with sweat and I had a heat head ache. If you are not from Miami you have to get use to this heat.</p>
<p>July 18, 2008- Thank God its Friday had a meeting with Victoria and Diego and two volunteers we talked about the Club house closings and I suggested that we do a press release to get it out to the media. Victoria said I will do it and also interview the volunteers. I drove</p>
<p>July 19, 2008- Saturday I went to tax training with Kevin and Victoria I was kind of cool I learned about Miami-Dade property tax stuff. I was surprised that Kevin knew all of the answers as much as the facilitator.</p>
<p>July 21, 2008- Week two Victoria asked me to run the CHW meeting on the upcoming Wednesday. She double booked herself of the Knight Foundation “Trabian Shorter” meeting and the CHW meeting which were held at the same time. I agreed to help her out……it seemed like the right thing to do. After all I wasn’t doing anything according to the emails I read. Victoria agreed to do the power point and all I had to do was present it.</p>
<p>July 22, 2008- Good morning Loveta your cell phone is officially turned off. Victoria emailed me the power points I read them and familiarized myself with the information I would be presenting the next day. How hard could a power point be? I did a few in school and I got a good grade.  Towards the end of the day I presented it to Victoria and she wasn’t quite pleased with what I had accomplished. So as I am presenting it to her on<br />
 the third power slide she say oh no this is how you say it. She got frustrated and started reading the slides out loud and very loudly when she was done she said like this I said in the nicest way I could Victoria you do the power point I was going to help you out but since it isn’t up to your standars you do it. She said no it’s fine the way you want to do it It’s just I double booked myself I am so stupid and I hate when I do that….Blah Blah Blah. As you can see I wasn’t the happiest Vista. I was salty and offended. I didn’t care anymore it was 5pm time to go.</p>
<p>July 23, 2008- It was Ms. Joyce’s Birthday. She looked like a Princess in all white and he diamonds were blinging (shining). We went to a Spanish restaurant I had plantains and red beans and rice. I felt like this was the start of something great you know being introduced to new cultures and foods. Ms. Joyce drove us to the CHW meeting I watched and listened I also passed out papers to everyone in the meeting.<br />
July 24, 2008- Rushed to a grant writing workshop with Victoria I drove it was on Biscayne we went Victoria felt like it was a waste of her time and she wanted to leave. I’m not sure if it could help me or not because we arrived late and we left early. I did not agree with leaving early but I did it. I felt like that was a waste of my time walking from Collins Center to Overtown to get the car then drive in the horrible traffic up and down Biscayne. Not only is it a waste of time I have to use my gas and my energy its too hot for all of that.</p>
<p>July 25, 2008- I read volunteer information I was feeling depressed and I was officially broke by this time no money in my pockets. Oh I met Mark for the first time and we had lunch to get to know each other. It was disaster to me mark wanted to know more about me and where I come from and after talking to him I became extremely depressed and emotional I was crying non stop. I was feeling as if I had again poured my heart out to someone who will never understand. As soon as I feel that I have a grip on life someone who appears to empathic to the poor wants to know details and while explaining I realized that they can see that I am weak and they are not helping me overcome any these adversities that I spoke about.</p>
<p>The only thing I remember was from that lunch date is Mark telling me to sell my car and take the bus, forget about my cell phone and use the Collins Center phone and email to communicate with the outside world. Oh and to create a budget for the money I hadn’t received yet. Now to someone who had support and money in the bank that sounds Ideal but for me a “ Po black Gurl”  trying to make it is unrealistic advise for my life at this time. Oh and Mark told me that if “I didn’t do a good job then I wont receive a good job at the end” Real encouraging huh?</p>
<p>July 26, 2008- Attended a commuity Summit with Kevin and Victoria it was nice and informative. Now I know that Miami-Dade is in as bad shape as every other city it just looks so beautiful. I met some really nice people I hope to network with.</p>
<p>July 28, 2008- Yes!! Pay day I got 450 dollars now. I felt like new money I was so tired of not having things I need. Appropriate comfortable work clothes and much more my favorite a full tank of gas. Worked at Diego’s</p>
<p>July 29, 2008- Worked at Diego’s I filled in for Diego on the conference call while he taught his class. The Conference call was long and boring I felt like all of the professionals wanted to all get a chance to talk about there view of digital divided and social inclusion. There went any solutions offered to this problem they keep talking about. They just schedule another time they can sit and talk. Blah Blah Blah.. I took notes and passed them along to Diego.</p>
<p>July 30, 2008- I worked at Diego’s</p>
<p>July 31, 2008- I drove Victoria to the Club house and met with Sidney I also helped do Tech Atlas on a few pc’s. </p>
<p>August 1, 2008- Victoria kicked me out of my cubical so she can work from my pc and hers at the same time. I wasn’t happy about that but I was just following along. She also made me work on the website that was due like 4 months ago. I asked her why is she rushing me to do it. She said because it was due a while ago and she needed to finish the report. Blah blah blah.<br />
I finished that site in like 2 hours as I was working in Victoria’s cubical she kept coming over to me stopping me to check her email and send emails. I began to get mad I was salty because according to my Vista training in Boston I was told that I don’t pick up the slack I’m not an intern so I will not receive intern responsibilities. I felt like she was pressuring me because she finished projects at the last minute and now she is pressed for time. I was salty so I wanted to wait for the right time to say something. The rest of the day I just hung out with Victoria and spent time getting to know her as a person. Oh I sat around listening to Victoria and Evelyn talked about who had HDHD the worst between the two of them. I checked my email and talked to my mother on the phone. You know doing regular stuff people do when they have an office/desk job.</p>
<p>August 2, 2008- I started grant writing training at Miami-Dade College from (9am-1pm) I was very cool I learned a lot and met a lot of good contacts.</p>
<p>August 4, 2008- Worked at Diego’s </p>
<p>August 5, 2008- Worked at Diego’s had a meeting St. Vincent De Paul. Met with Victor Martell and Diego about writing a grant for “SVDP” and YETEC the meeting went great I looked great and Victor Martell liked me and wanted to hear what I had to say.</p>
<p>August 6, 2008- Came to the Collins Center to do some work (you know Diego doesn’t have any resources and without phone or internet it is very difficult for me to think and really do work as far as research and writing goes.) Took the train to meet a volunteer that was coming to the volunteer orientation that Victoria postponed until Aug 16, 2008. On the way Victoria realized that once again she forgot to do something which was bringing the volunteer information for the Volunteer. Thank God that I had all of that information in my binder so I gave it to her and she appeared to be prepared for the meeting.</p>
<p>So what I had originally planned to do I had to put it on hold to do this Victoria stuff and everyday I come into the Collins Center it is like that.<br />
Example: if I get here at 9am I am dripping with sweat I like to cool off and check all of my email accounts I also read my horoscope. Not with Victoria standing over my shoulders or looking at me through the window that’s by our cubical. When I come in she will say ok so I am going to give you 5 mins then we will go over…I stopped her and said no I’m gonna need more than 5 mins to get myself together. At that point I really don’t even want to here anything that she has to say. I’m thinking how could you be so inconsiderate just give me a chance to get settled. But I would never say it to her because I’m thinking that’s just Victoria she doesn’t’ know any better. (Now how could that be a true statement if she is a college grad?) It’s not true, that’s when I realized that she thinks I work for her something as if I am her personal assistant or something. </p>
<p>August 7-8, 2008- Worked at Collins Center researched volunteer management information for Victoria. When I found information I though would be helpful to include for the Volunteers Victoria told me that she already read most of the information and she didn’t need what I found for a the project and I should just read for my own understanding. So just imagine how a person might feel after that? Well let me tell you I felt like what is it all worth?<br />
I stayed late and invited Kevin and Victoria over Sat. to help me write a grant.<br />
August 9, 2008- Kevin and Victoria came over to help me write the grant come to find out I didn’t have enough information from Diego to even start the grant.</p>
<p>August 11, 2008-AT the Collins Center check my email and saw that I have fallen further into delinquency with my phone company.  I was sad Victoria told me she was gonna help me find a second job on the beach because that is what she had to do for a little while. So we took our lunch break early to do that.  I got all my resumes together and we walked to my car and drove to the beach. I didn’t get a chance to change my clothes so I didn’t find a job because I wasn’t looking slutty enough. I had on my Vista polo shirt and black work pants and penny loafer’s not proper attire for south beach. We got lost and Victoria gave me 10 dollars for gas because I was hot and salty. When we got back to Collins Center Victoria asked me to drop her off at the door because she had a lunch date at 2pm. “truth is she didn’t want to talk that long hot walk from Overtown to Collins Center” So I dropped her off and I parked and when I started walking back It started pouring on me. I was salty and wet so by the time I got back to me car hit had stopped raining and I was hot wet and sticky. So I went home to change and vent.</p>
<p>August 12, 2008- At Collins Center filled in for Diego on the phone conference can you believe that there were only a few people who called in. Shortly after it started we receives several emails from people who were on last time saying they couldn’t make it. “I told yall it was boring and a waste of time and to prove it most of the people did not participate.<br />
She also put a work plan together for me when I received the email I was very upset it was a list of stuff to do and times to complete them. I was like is she serious. I had already made my mind up that I wasn’t going to do that stuff.<br />
Then we have a meeting she then tells me Mark and Donna are getting a divorce. Now whose problem is that? I felt like that was a waste of time. Why would I want to be caught in the middle of some grown people drama I didn’t come here for that. I don’t care one way or another if they stay married or get divorced. That’s just how I feel I expressed that the best way I could.</p>
<p>Mark came by and told Victoria that here work plan was oppressive and it should be monthly. Now why would she create on in the first place is my question. I don’t work for her.</p>
<p>Here is the work plan:<br />

<p>Are you serious who times people when they give them work to do?<br />
I was very salty when I received it.<br />
August 14 2008- Congratulations I made it today is my 1 month anniversary as a vista<br />
went to the Collins Center first to type up research and job description for Diego. I put on my new dress. Diego told me I have to make a good impression we had a meeting with Green Family Foundation. It was awesome I met Ms. Kim and Kevin Koster they were great we shared ideas and planned to meet again. This was the highlight of my stay hear. I was finally feeling like I was fitting in and finding my place here. </p>
<p>August 15, 2008- The honey moon is officially over. I was so excited to tell Victoria about what happened at the meeting. I told her that the Green Family Foundation liked me I told her how cool and down to earth they were. I was so happy that I was blessed with an opportunity to meet with funders it’s like being behind the scenes of the non –profit world. I feel that I will end up in a position of power like that. I could totally do a job like that. They inspired me so much. </p>
<p>I so started doing my field report for CTC Vista as I am doing it Victoria keeps coming into my cubical asking me to do stuff like call subway and see what time they are open, find icebreakers for the volunteer meeting tomorrow and listen to her menu and follow the list of task she wants me to complete. I said ok I called subway they open at 9 I went on line and found two easy icebreakers. I waited from 10am to 2pm for her to email me the papers she wants me to staple and put together for the meeting tomorrow. She asked me to pick up the projector from Diego’s and bring it to the meeting.</p>
<p>As I was leaving Victoria asked me where was I going I told her I was done for the day. I had also received some very disturbing news about my family and I was in tears I was trying to hold them in until I got outside but she started following me and yelling my name. I was freaked out. As polite as I could be trying to hold my face up say so my tears wouldn’t fall out of me watery eyes I told her I will see her tomorrow. That wasn’t enough for her she followed me onto the elevator and was shouting at me telling me I had to stay because she still had things for me to do that are due tomorrow. I told her politely that she had all morning to email me papers to staple but she chose not to and wait to the last min as always. She said I was on my lunch break I said and me too. As I walked into the garage she grabbed my arm I snatched it back and said don’t touch me. I do not work for Victoria and I am gone for the day I will see you tomorrow. She grabbed me again and said I hope that when you get a job that you don’t screw it up blah blah blah I walked away and told her to contact Donna if she has a problem with me. She screamed I’m calling Mark. I told her to call her mother.</p>
<p>I couldn’t believe that she insulted me I have more education, training, and experience than she does I will never take orders from someone who can even remember how to get back to the Collins Center when we are 4 blocks away. I have never insulted Victoria I always give her compliments. I honestly do not appreciate the way she behaved I have never insulted Victoria even when I felt like she really has severe HDHD. What gives her the right to dictate to me and insult me I very uncomfortable around her. I fell like she wanted a reaction out of me that I was unable to give she put her hands on me during a heated argument provoking me to get “Street On Her”  I’m deeply offended that she would even try me like that.</p>

	    <p>This sounds like a bad situation and I am particularly concerned about Loveta's personal safety in her workplace:</p>
<p>"As I walked into the garage she grabbed my arm I snatched it back and said don’t touch me. I do not work for Victoria and I am gone for the day I will see you tomorrow. She grabbed me again and said I hope that when you get a job that you don’t screw it up blah blah blah I walked away and told her to contact Donna if she has a problem with me."</p>
<p>Is the CTC Vista leadership looking into this?<br />
The idea that a coworker was physically aggressive with a Vista is very disturbing to me. Having worked in a business atmosphere for years, I am aware that this type of behavior is subject to zero tolerance. </p>
<p>I hope I can assume that, for Loveta, myself, and all the other Vistas in the field, I can expect the same kind of protection under the law in my Vista position that I would expect in any other workplace environment. </p>
<p>Please post or communicate what the Vista policy is on workplace violence. I would also like to know how this serious situation is being addressed and what support a Vista has a right to expect RE: personal safety in the workplace.</p>

				<p>The second month is going swimmingly.  The work has really picked up and I'm feeling good in my job.  Right now I'm very busy working on re-vamping the website. My supervisor and I spent the last few weeks creating a facilitation guide for people to use and now I'm working on getting that content onto the website, making the website more efficient and pretty, and using direct language so people will feel comfortable using our resources.  Honestly, I'm not sure how the project (thousand kites) has survived as long as it has without some of these resources.  </p>
<p>I also created an image that folks can insert into their blogs or websites or whatnot to "advertise" the project. So I'll insert it here!: </p>

<p>click on it! it takes you to the project!!</p>
<p>What's coming next for us in the mountains?  We'll be attending the Critical Resistance conference out in Oakland next week, and I'll be presenting a workshop (my first with the org), so that'll be exciting.  And then I move on to a big project that I mentioned last post--the digital storytelling map.  I'm going to refrain from talking too much about it yet, because I want to wait til I actually get into it. But look for that next time!</p>

				<p>Month two is in full effect and the list of things to do keeps growing and growing. Not sure where I left off last month, but here's what's been going on. </p>
<p>We've been working on raising public awareness about the Digital Television Transition that will happen in Feb. of next year. The DTV transition is when the nation's over-the-air television signal will switch from analog to digital. While the transition can potentially open up a channel for new innovations in wireless broadband (potentially because the FCC hasn't decided yet), the pressing issue is making sure that those who receive over-the-air television are ready for the transition. The government has tried it's best to spread the word, but there are growing fears that many people will lose their signal because they don't have a digital converter box. That's where we've been stepping in. We've jumped in on the efforts to spread the word about the transition and have held a few events around New York City. We have one coming up this week in Harlem. Also, we've worked in partnership with other public interest groups to make sure that the government allows for the unused spectrum (known as white spaces) to be a public resource that can be used for wireless broadband technology. </p>
<p>Locally, we've been following the New York City franchise agreement with Verizon. Verizon has just been given allowed to offer FiOS services in New York City and while the new service is welcomed competition to incumbent cable duopoly, the agreement process was rushed and left very little time for public input. We worry that the agreement made very little effort to protect the public interest and provides little for consumer protection, which means that while the new competition will bring some immediate drops in service costs, the consumers will still have to struggle with irresponsible and negligent practices on the part of service providers. PPH has been working to try and make sure the public is aware of the process and we've advocated for another public comment period where New Yorker's can learn about the new FiOS deal and voice their opinions about what they want from the new service provider. </p>
<p>The next few months are going to be busy. We're getting ready to start a new round of community journalist trainings. I'm excited about it because I'm going to get a chance to do the trainings my self. Also, I'm going to be doing my IST which is going to rock. I was able to find a 12-week feature article writing workshop. It's going to help with the monthly articles that we publish for Gotham Gazette and it'll give me a good excuse to practice my writing. Other than that, all is well out here in the big city. Till next time.</p>

	    <p>Totally seen ads for this transition in the local post office, but not something widely publicized at all.  Totally seems like a huge move by the telecommunications industry that could limit people's access.</p>
<p>Those community journalist trainings seem like a really great antithesis to any cynicism or ignorance (present party not excluded!) that's out there.</p>
<p>Any chance PPH would be interested in becoming a NAMAC Member?  PPH seems super cool and could be a great asset to our membership.  Many of our orgs are media/public media related, but I think could stand to be a bit more informed about issues out there (our policy and advocacy area of the website could use some love).</p>
<p>One of our co-directors actually wants to push outreach towards a more politically active member-base.</p>
<p>P.S.  Are  you connected to Joshua Brietbart?  I just found that he's connected to NAMAC via the Ethos Group via Sascha Meinrath via Helen De Michiel (co-director at NAMAC where i work).</p>
<p>How's things in NY?</p>

				<p>My first two months here have been awesome. The commute is not as bad as I imagined it to be, it's become a routine and I am getting really used to it.</p>
<p>The A-VOYCE program is amazing, although my work plan stated that I would be working with web 2.0 tools, I have done this and that. </p>
<p>When I first came in the office was crazy, there were so many interns and youth all over the place. The internet was lagging... it was basically dial up. For the first couple of weeks I did not do much. I worked a lot with the youth. Our youth program does walking tours and they have a live radio show. So during the summer, some youth are training for the walking tours and others are training for the radio show. I got to know most of the youth and they're actually very fun and mature. </p>
<p>We've already had two events, the August Moon Festival and Films at the Gate. Films at the Gate was a huge success for our program. </p>
<p>Work wise, I have developed a myspace, facebook fan page, and facebook group for A-VOYCE. I recently got a black macbook, and I have learned to use photoshop and illustrator. I am kind of obsessed with my mac actually. I've been using photoshop to create.. I guess you could call them fliers for an energy efficient program that I have taken over. Basically, CITGO is willing to give us 20,000 lightbulbs to give to 1000 households in the Chinatown area and also Boston area. We have to run workshops to teach applicants about energy efficiency. I had to have all of the paperwork translated into Chinese, which a youth has done for me. The program would bring in a lot of money for the youth program and it will also be good for the environment. haha.</p>
<p>Another project I am currently working on is what I call the Boston Globe Project. Our executive director was contacted by Marty Baron, the editor at the Boston Globe, to have stories translated into Chinese and then podcasted on their website boston.com. What we would do is read the stories find the top stories for the week and then have a youth translate it into Chinese using our equipment. </p>
<p>The office life is interesting, lots of different personalities, and everyone is always so busy. There's always drama too with staff and A-VOYCE, always interesting and entertaining. </p>
<p>p.s. dim sum never happened and jin ho is gone.</p>

<p>You tricked me with promises of dim sum stories.  I am interested in those light bulbs you have.  And the listserve could be a cool way to keep others up-to-date on the films and whatnot.</p>
<p>I guess the Internet sit is figured out?  And can the kids lead the environment workshops, cause that would be interesting.</p>

<p>Have you seen Firefox's LinkChecker add-on?  You can quickly install it in Firefox by clicking this link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kevinfreitas.net/extensions/linkchecker/" title="install LinkChecker">http://www.kevinfreitas.net/extensions/linkchecker/</a></p>
<p><img src="http://www.kevinfreitas.net/extensions/linkchecker/linkchecker-options-colors.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Then, it highlights all bad links in a page so you can speed up the tedious task of highlighting bad links.</p>

<p>I just visited the Media Arts Center of San Diego and they're getting set to launch 12 new statewide digital storytelling stations with public libraries STATEWIDE!</p>
<p>Their Operations Director is going to be flying around the state doing train-the-trainer workshops with staff at said libraries.</p>
<p>do you know if MACSD is aware of the new CDS story portal?  Is MACSD aware of the Stories For Change website?</p>

				<p>This first month at California Community Technology Policy Group (CCTPG), which is a program under Community Partners (CP), was a welcoming experience.  The people at CP are very warm and since most are not part of CCTPG, it has been great getting to know more about their work.  Not only that, my supervisor has allowed me to go to non-CCTPG meetings so that I can get a good feel for CP.  This of course, has helped me adjust to the work setting and to culture of CP.  </p>
<p>At CP, we have had many people leave and find new jobs and so it has been very busy in recruiting for the open positions.  On this note, my supervisor has been with CCTPG for less than a year and so he as well as I has been striving to make sense as to what direction CCTPG needs to go.  He came to CCTPG with the database problem on his plate and so far, it’s been clearing up because he is understanding what needs to be done.  </p>
<p>CCTPG is staffed by three people, including myself, and so recently it has been getting a bit busier.  One of the things I have been working on is website issues.  Our website is based on Drupal and there are some database issues that need to be fixed.  I was assigned with the task of looking for a Drupal consultant.  We have been looking for a few weeks and we have had some good candidates.  However we might change the website platform to Joomla! (I like how they added the exclamation point at the end, you know it makes me wanna shout! Shout!...) since CP’s website is also based on it.  Also, we have been working on a huge California Wireless Report with case studies on cities that have applied wireless in their communities (i.e. Anaheim).  I have been editing and looking over the report.  It should be out soon.  I will post as soon as it comes out.</p>
<p>Just to give you a bit of a background on what CCTPG does: our basic push is for policy that will fund CTCs, education tech, and other technology that will contribute to workforce development and close the digital divide.  We have state wide coalition, which I am attempting to manage by setting up meetings and clarifying what policies to push for (this will be one of my main jobs this year).  </p>
<p>On other issues, my commute from my apartment to work is very enjoyable. I get to sleep in the train, read, talk to interesting people—sometimes I get to meet visitors from other countries.  My supervisor is very understanding of my situation and so on the first week he declared “Edward you will not go hungry” and that same week he invited me out to lunch a couple times.  </p>
<p>Finally, to stay updated with the newest tech/programs, I have been reading CTC emails and checking out TechCrunch. Hope all is well CTC VISTA peeps!</p>

			 	<a href="node/1335.html" title="Freezing in August" rel="bookmark"><h1>Freezing in August</h1></a>
			 				 	
			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p>My first month out here in San Francisco at Aspiration has been cold.  I'm used to humid, high 80s in August and I come here and get 50s?  Craziness.  Other than realizing I didn't pack enough long sleeves, my concerns have focused on getting familiar with the programs that I need to use on an everyday basis for Aspiration.  As the Community Manager for our website, Social Source Commons, one of the things that both my boss Gunner (real name, Allen Gunn) and I want to do is really step up the community aspect of the website.  Right now it's a place to find software tools for nonprofits but it lacks a real person to person interactivity that we really want to include into the overall feel of the site.  On top of figuring out how to fernaggle more people into the site, I've also been put in charge of revitalizing the blog.  In the near future it will turn toward more bug-finding, member-interviewing, and behind the scenes web work.  But for now I'm content working in the broader “idea” level.  </p>
<p>Finding a place to live in this city (on an Americoprs stipend no less) is on the same level of lottery-winning.  It's ridiculous.  Luckily I found a cheap place in a good neighborhood that I could afford with the stipend.  Sure, the apartment itself is super sketchy and my roomies may or may not be mentally stable BUT who needs to stay home when they live in a city like San Francisco?  Other than providing a warm couch to sleep on while I endlessly searched for housing, my supervisor Gunner has been really awesome.  He's helped me out with everything that I could have asked for and always makes sure I have what I need.  Because Aspiration is relatively small, Gunner, Mike (the operations manager) and I have become pretty close, both literally and figuratively.  Luckily they are both really good at what they do.  Which I would say is almost a bad thing because in reality, Aspiration could use about 3 Gunners and 2 Mikes but they both enjoy doing everything so they are  constantly busy.  One of the worries that I had when I first got here was that I would have to really fight to fit myself into their schedules and while that's been true to a certain extent, I feel like they do a good job of not forgetting that I have a job here that's rather separate but still important.  We'll see how it pans out in the months to come.  </p>
<p>Gunner is mildly paranoid about Microsoft and government interference, (most likely due to his affiliation with protest groups) so our office is very pro-open source.  We use Open Office for all of our document needs and we'll soon be transitioning to Ubuntu as the office operating system.  It should be sweet because I've always wanted to get into using Linux but never had the right push to do it.  Other than working on open source programs, I use a lot of tech mailing lists (NTEN, TechSoup, Riders) and blogs (Beth's Blog, Zen and the Art of Nonprofit technology) to stay on top of the nonprofit technology sector.  </p>
<p>Things are going well for the first month and all I can hope is that they stay good when I start getting more into the bulk of what I'll be doing.  Luckily, right now when I'm still learning the ropes, my coworkers have been really helpful and the tool resources that I've come in contact with have saved the day.  Hope everything is going well for everyone!</p>

	    <p>In re the cool weather, yes, well, that's what one of my Oakland friends referred to as "the winter in the summer".  San Francisco, Berkeley, and Oakland occupy a very special pocket of climate different from the rest of the US on account of the arrangement of the mountain ridges in combination with, I guess, prevailing winds, and the ocean.  As in Africa, there's a dry season and a wet season.  In the dry season you can count on it not raining; that's what people who live in Oakland and San Francisco told me.</p>
<p>There might be at some point (when people are a little less busy) some opportunities for your org and my org to learn from each other, since mine also consults with nonprofits about their tools.  <a href="http://ccts.ubalt.edu/" title="http://ccts.ubalt.edu/">http://ccts.ubalt.edu/</a></p>
<p>In re preference for open-source operating systems and non-monopoly software tools: Yay!  I just upgraded my notebook to Hardy Heron, the most recent Long-term Support version of Ubuntu, and it's working great.  Hardy loads a nice modern version of Firefox and Flash; they play videos fine (unlike the versions of Firefox and Flash the prior Long-term Support version of Ubuntu loaded).  I briefly brought up the OOo word processor and it seems to work; I think I checked the spreadsheet program the same way.</p>

	    <p>I think Gunner is one of the people who gave presentations at a technology conference that was held at the same time as my own PSO. He seems like a cool guy. I sympathize with the whole paranoia thing: my hard-drive is encrypted, my email digitally signed, and one of my coworkers once told me that he had rigged all of the servers at work with a script to scramble their hard-drives at a moment's notice, in case we were ever raided by the FBI ;)<br />

				<p>I am working on a software system that can be deployed in web servers for online publications.</p>
<p>The system supports the publication of <em>editions</em> on given dates.  An edition contains articles, which can have been written by various authors.  Editors can plan the edition up until its publication date and upload the articles in their final versions.  From the publication date on, the public can read the edition.</p>
<p>When the public first visits the web site, they see the current edition.  If they choose, they can navigate to an index of past editions.</p>
<p>Readers can also see an index of the topics covered.  Editors can highlight for the readers, those articles that they think especially worthy with respect to a given topic.</p>
<p>To justify public support via CTC VISTA for this development, let me point out its usefulness for publications covering the problems and questions surrounding the making and carrying out of <em>public policy</em>.  Owing to online publishing's lower cost relative to the print media and television, and its better support for reader participation, it can improve the level and quality of democratic participation.</p>

				<p>Ni hao!</p>
<p>Hi everyone! I am very excited to be writing this field report – I have gotten so much done over the last month I’ve forgotten to write! Things here at the Kwong Kow Chinese School were rolling well before I arrived, and so I hit the ground right in the middle of the all-day summer program. One of my biggest and most immediate projects is getting the school licensed as an after school program (it’s been around for 93 years but isn’t officially licensed with the state). To begin, we planned, staged, and reflected on our first fire drill, evacuating over 300 people in 3 minutes and 30 seconds. In addition, I have been working hard to organize and create the extensive paperwork needed, and further on getting it translated. I have found that learning Chinese will be very helpful to this position, and thus have been sitting in on Kindergarten class as well as studying on my own (I have been spoken to in Chinese twice on the T!). The kids are awesome and when they walk by my office door every morning and afternoon for breakfast and lunch they greet me in Chinese. It’s so hard it feels like learning two languages, but I will be able to do so much with it once I’m a bit better. </p>
<p>Next week, I hope to attend a week-long conference at the Boston Children's Museum, mornings spent improving Mandarin pronunciation (but taught in Mandarin too! eek!), and afternoons on thematic unit planning. I’ll be attending it with teachers from the school and will use this shared experience to help shape the curriculum I’m helping design for the school. The first draft I drew up was given high remarks by the head of Foreign Languages of the Boston Public Schools, so I brushed my shoulders off after that. Don’t worry though, it hasn’t gone to my head, despite any great ideas I may have, I still can’t explain them to the teachers, so I’m consistently humbled (and motivated) by this language barrier. </p>
<p>Overall, I’ve found sitting in front of the computer for about 9 to 5 a bit tedious, as I am used to running classrooms or at least sitting in them for more than the last few years (at least I have Kindergarten on M,T,R!). However, I’m becoming a masterful table-manipulator in Word, pin-yin typist in NJStar, and curriculum/resource/everything researcher on Google. I loved reading through these first field reports and look forward to hearing how you’re all doing next month!</p>
<p>Zai Jian!  </p>
<p>Katrina</p>

				<p>As part of my job as the Community Journalism Coordinator for MAIN, I will be reporting, writing and producing a local news show on our radio station, wpvm 103.5 fm. In order to prepare for this, I have been sitting in on other people’s radio programs to get a feel for the studio and to observe how to use the equipment. Last week I was invited to sit in by the hosts of a program called Wordplay, a show devoted to poetry and creative writing. I have been reading and writing poetry for as long as I can remember so, as you can imagine, I was very excited about this opportunity!<br />
As luck would have it, one of the hosts was out for the day because of a family reunion, so the other host emailed me on Friday asking me to bring a poem along that I enjoy as well as some music I’ve been listening to. I spent Saturday hunting through the poetry books on my bookshelf trying to figure out who to read. I settled on an old love of mine, Pablo Neruda, and chose to read “Fable of the mermaid and the drunks” and “Ode to the sea.” I also picked some Paul Simon and brought a cd of some friends of mine to play.<br />
It went really well. I was extremely nervous about being live on air, but once I got into the poetry and grew more comfortable with the headset and the mic, I really didn’t want to leave the studio! </p>
<p>In other preparations for our news program, I have been cultivating a small group of Ashevillians who will be community journalists along my side. I have been attending community meetings including a CopWatch meeting and a Coalition of Asheville Neighborhoods meeting, where I have given brief presentations on MAIN’s community journalism project.<br />
I have attended various protests and vigils in downtown Asheville to test out my recording equipment and practice audio editing. I have also taught some of the core group of reporters how to use this equipment and held mock interviewing sessions followed by learning how to edit.<br />
I have also signed up MAIN to be involved in Project Connect, an event held in Asheville to unite the homeless community with resources in the city. I will be there with my recorder conducting interviews to be compiled on MAIN’s web page, to be aired at some point in some form or fashion as part of the news program, as well as to be used by the Homeless Initiative of Asheville as documentation of the plight of the homeless in our city. We are hoping this material can be used to advocate for the homeless at City Council meetings and the like when politicians make decisions on things like housing and development in Asheville.<br />
I have also been sitting down with one of the web development staffers to learn more about how to redevelop MAIN’s web page so as to incorporate the community journalism project. This has been an interesting process because I really have not had any of this kind of technical training or experience, but Chris has been extremely patient and supportive!<br />
I am in the process of researching organizations that support local independent media or help to explain the phenomenon on community journalism. I have found these sites:<br />

<p>other cool sites: <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" title="www.wordpress.org">www.wordpress.org</a> and <a href="http://www.archive.org" title="www.archive.org">www.archive.org</a></p>
<p>In my down time, I have been reading a lot of local news and listening to local news programs on the radio. I have also done research on genetically modified foods, development and the housing crisis, and the ecological crisis in Patagonia (kind of off topic, but every thing's connected in the end). Part of this job has to do with rethinking how we frame stories and trying to create new ways of framing stories that help create dialogs in the community about important issues like (over) development, homelessness, the abuse of power (cop watch), but also to help empower people with information and create an awareness in Asheville that will allow people to create a better (and talk about what that means) city.</p>
<p>On an odd note, I found myself with a pen and a beer in my hand at a friends house, ripping apart a local magazine advertising all of the beautiful mountain top, golf course, huge housing developments surrounding Asheville. It's really cool to have a job that encourages me to read the fine print and tell other people about it!</p>
<p>Hope everyone else is getting along well. Finances aside, I'm pretty happy at this point. </p>
<p>p.s. I'm figuring out how to get the WordPlay media in here. It will probably be in an above post.</p>

				<p>My how time flies! I just realized it’s been a month here at the 119 Gallery. I’ve spent it settling in and getting to know a whole new community. While it’s safe to say I miss my island home, it’s nice to be on a bigger piece of land. Lowell is a great town. There are a ton of artists here, a ton of non- profits, and a ton of interesting people. </p>
<p>Last Thursday a feature writer from Artscope Magazine came to interview Mary Ann about the ‘Mask’ show happening in the first part of September (you can check it out at <a href="http://119gallery.org/news/mask_nr.pdf" title="http://119gallery.org/news/mask_nr.pdf">http://119gallery.org/news/mask_nr.pdf</a>). We’re all pretty excited about it because Artscope is one of the top two art mags in the area so it will be great exposure. We realized that if we can get into Artscope, we should be setting our sights higher. I’ve started scouting around for bigger regional and national art press contacts, so if any of you out there in cyberlandia have any suggestions, send ‘em! I’d be totally stoked!</p>
<p>On Friday my boss Mary Ann and I ventured into Cambridge to check out the Papercut Zine Library. The gallery is hosting a zine exhibition in October (I'm attaching the press release) and we’re looking for more local artists to bring on board. It was pretty impressive to see how many quality, unique zines are produced right here in New England. I browsed publications on subjects ranging from The Worst Poetry In The World (that was the actual title) to transgender comics to anarchist manifestos. We left feeling elated at all the possibilities for the show. </p>
<p>I have been working with a great marketing consultant named Deby Baker from Jericho on the marketing plan for the last three weeks and she’s been a huge help. We decided it's time to give the member database a huge overhaul (it’s largely unfiltered and needs to be organized into member interests and demographics so that we can reach our constituents in a more targeted fashion) so I’ve been playing around with Salesforce in preparation of migrating our info over by the end of the month. </p>
<p>Before we move all of our info, Deby and I are working on putting a survey monkey together to get a better grasp on our contacts’ interests so that we can make sure to minimize superfluous emails. We plan to ask people about their preferred form of contact (email, text, facebook etc. etc.) and interests. This is because we are way more than an art gallery in terms of events and we want to make sure the right people know about the right events. In any given month we have everything from dance performances, art receptions, heavy metal bands, experimental noise or sushi battles. </p>
<p>I’m pretty stoked on the new job.</p>

	    <p>The 'zine thing sounds nice.  My buddies from college had their own 'zines...I think my roomie even made one issue in our dorm room.  That sounds like a great exhibit and I plan on trying to make it.</p>
<p>Also, good work with the marketing consultant.  At this rate you will be leading the marketing discussion for the online trainings.</p>
