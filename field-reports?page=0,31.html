				<p>Happy New year everyone. I hope everyone had a happy New Year. My new year is as busy as my end of the year events were. First let me say that the Pink House kids are great. The staff I&#39;m working with are great. My supervisor is great and as busy as I am. We just recently got 20 Dell computers from a group who wanted to give our kids computers for Christmas.  This is the second group that has donated computers to our kids. A local group in our area also gave our kids some great christmas gifts. We are offering a webcasting class to the children and parents in our community. We also had a group donate some dictionaries to our kids. </p>
<p>On the community level, we are working on our goals to intergrate the community into the center and we have more traffic everyday. We had a neighborhood breakfast that was a smash hit for the seniors it was sponsored for as well as the younger set of residents who attended. We had the usual southern breakfast but we  also had great speakers and singing by the local youth choir and gulla poetry by a local poet. </p>
<p>Our new service project will have a lot of techie things attached to it, webcasting, podcasting, possibly even radio broadcasting. We plan to make our own commercials and advertisements. Stay tune for the next phase. Fun, Fun Fun!</p>
<p>Renae Out..........</p>

				<p>What up VISTAS-<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Danielle Martin kindly asked me to be a 'guest blogger' to write a<br />
little bit about my experience as a CTC VISTA and/or my experiences<br />
post-VISTA. I guess I'll start with an introduction and what my<br />
background is with the Project...<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I am a media artist and community organizer living in San Diego. I like<br />
to figure out creative ways to use my skills to organize communities<br />
online.<br />
In 2006, while completing my year of service with AmeriCorps, I<br />
developed the capacity of two community technology programs in San<br />
Diego.<br />
One project I worked on was with the <a href="http://www.thecentersd.org" target="_blank">San<br />
Diego LGBT Center</a>. While there, I developed extensive<br />
'train-the-trainer' curriculum to assist with the Center's <a href="http://www.thecentersd.org/digital" target="_blank"><span>Digital Storytelling Project</span></a>.<br />
This included rewriting their manual, developing an innovative<br />
do-it-yourself cd-rom 'toolkit' for trainers and community activists,<br />
and providing ongoing curriculum and technology assesment to the<br />
Center's IT Manager.<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
My work with the <a href="http://www.sdctc.org" target="_blank">San Diego Community Technology Coalition</a><br />
included a complete overhaul of the organization's community web<br />
portal. This included installation and configuration of their<br />
administrative CRM (constituent relationship management) system (using<br />
the EXCELLENT <a href="http://www.civicrm.org" target="_blank">CivicSpace</a> platform based on <a href="http://www.drupal.org" target="_blank">Drupal</a><br />
- the same 'content management system' used for this site) consultation<br />
and implementation of appropriate site features, as well as research,<br />
development and staff training on use of the portal.<br />
I am still closely involved with the SDCTC and currently wear many hats<br />
for the them including Web Content Manager, Online Outreach<br />
Coordinator, and general Technical Question Answerer.<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I also work for the <a href="http://www.mediaartscenter.org" target="_blank">Media Arts Center of San Diego</a> at<br />
their <a href="http://www.mediaartscenter.org/site/pp.aspx?c=dfLIJPOvHoE&amp;b=1623599" target="_blank">Digital Storytelling Station</a><br />
helping people tell their stories. It's an awesome organization that<br />
has many projects in community-based media and coordinates the annual<br />
San Diego Latino Film Festival.<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I also co-founded and help organize a node of <a href="http://www.share.dj" target="_blank">Share</a>,<br />
a global network of artists that provides infrastructure and support<br />
for new media communities worldwide. &nbsp;I'm currently talking<br />
with the director of MACSD to see if we can combine the efforts of the <a href="http://www.sharesd.org" target="_blank">San<br />
Diego node of Share</a> with those of MACSD into a 'New Media<br />
Coordinator'. <span>I don't<br />
think I would have the confidence or knowledge to pursue this (my<br />
dream) had I NOT been a VISTA</span> - negotiating the creation<br />
of a new position with the director of a prestigious media arts org?<br />
&nbsp;Sweet.<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
When not regularly contributing content to the SDCTC, I can be found<br />
performing interesting electronic music in cafes, galleries and bars in<br />
and around San Diego. You can read also more about me <a href="http://www.memeshift.com" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Anyway, that's all from me for now. How are YOUR VISTA years going?<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Signing off,<br /><br />
Morgan<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<span>*******Morgan's Tip of<br />
the Week</span>:<br />
BLOG YOUR VISTA EXPERIENCES! <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Why is this cool? Because: <br /><br />
<br /><br />
a) keeping track of the important work you do is good for the<br />
betterment of humanity - no joke, I'm a storycollector for a living.<br />
Stories are have a curious tendency to elicit authentic connection to<br />
each other like that - important for the kind of work <span>COMMUNITY</span><br />
technology center VISTAs are doing <br /><br />
<br /><br />
b) you get highly ranked in search engines. &nbsp;This is just<br />
simply nice for your ego - they even call self-searches 'ego<br />
searches':) <br /><br />
<br /><br />
and c) something the CTC VISTA orientation doesn't really mention, but<br />
you can think of your blog as a RESUME for future work. I didn't find<br />
this out until later, but timely record of all your accomplishments,<br />
failures and things you learned looks GREAT to employers (and you can<br />
always edit it to put your &lsquo;best&rsquo; face forward).</p>

				<p>This new year brings on a new phase of me being behind on getting y&#39;all together, but here&#39;s to New Year&#39;s resolutions!  I&#39;ll be starting the individual check-in calls tomorrow and hope we can schedule the next conference call for <strong>Friday, January 26th at 2pm EST.</strong>  At the last call, we had a guest speaker, which seemed to work out well.  There was talk of focusing our next call on youth development and tips for engaging youth in media projects.  I&#39;ll try to get a guest speaker but let me know if there&#39;s anything specific you&#39;re willing to share with the group.  </p>
<p>Also, will the lack of a CTCNet conference this year, we&#39;re a little more open to <strong>attending other conferences.</strong>  Since your org is required to send you to one, it might be interesting if we find one related to digital media that we could aim for a critical mass of Digital Media CTC VISTAs.  The <a href="http://www.namac.org/category.cfm?id=1&amp;cid=92&amp;monly=0" target="_blank">NAMAC</a> Conference would be perfect, but it&#39;s not until October 2007.  The <a href="http://www.alliancecm.org/index.php?page_id=106" target="_blank">Alliance for Community Media</a> conference might only be interesting for folks in cable access stations (July in MN).  Many of the other CTC VISTAs will be going to the <a href="http://nten.org/ntc-register" target="_blank">NTEN</a> Conference in April, which may appeal to your techie side...Anyway, I&#39;ll start looking around, but suggestions are welcome!  </p>
<p>Finally, as I spammed everyone in the general CTC VISTA list, our <strong>guest blogger</strong> this month will be <strong>Morgan Sully,</strong> former VISTA and digital media/storytelling guru, so keep an eye on the blogs and get ready to comment and ask him questions galore.  Oh and it wouldn&#39;t hurt to blog some photos or videos of some stuff you&#39;re working on too (according to <a href="node/353.html" target="_blank">Dina&#39;s blog entry</a>, apparently I need to start bribing everyone with homemade cookies...)</p>
<p>PS. Thanks to a lovely gift of time from Mr. Ben Sheldon, I&#39;ve got a new personal blog and portfolio up at <a href="http://verdesmoke.com" target="_blank">http://verdesmoke.com</a>.  It&#39;s mostly for grad school&#39;s to look at for now but soon I hope to be waxing philosophically about life there as well. </p>

				<p>This past week I took some time off and went to visit my friends, Darrin and Courtney in Cincinnati Ohio. Before I left I let Lauren Bratslavsky at Media Bridges know that I&#39;d be in town., so that we could possibly get together.</p>
<p>After a few emails and phone calls Lauren and I decided to meet Friday at Media Bridges at 12:30. I walked in and really liked the building. It&#39;s one of these refurbished old buildings and just has a neat look. Lauren met me and showed me around. </p>
<p>They recently got new iMacs for their edit suites and such. They were smart enough to make sure they had DVD burners. Unlike the new mini editing lab here at the CMC. Over all I was impressed by the facility and the people I met. </p>
<p>It turned out that they have a second VISTA, Kathy Dumas, there as well. The three of us walked to a Deli for lunch. We had a spirit discussion about being a VISTA, problems facing Community Media, patriarchy, lax direction, and other stuff. It seems that VISTA&#39;s at Media Bridges do not get made to feel like they are part of the staff, as I do here in Grand Rapids.</p>
<p>After lunch we returned to Media Bridges. One thing we talked about was the program Garageband. I had put together a tutorial on it and they had some questions about it. So we went upstairs and I gave them an overview of how the program works. We made a little VISTA music piece. It is rather odd. lol.</p>
<p>Lauren gave me some assitance with the program Livetype, which we&#39;ve had trouble with here at the CMC.  </p>
<p>It was a great visit. Both relaxing and  productive. VISTA&#39;s communicating and working together. I hope I get the chance to show them around the Community Media Center here sometime. I just emailed them my tutorial for Garageband and I will probably hear back from them with more info on Livetype and a program for ripping DVD&#39;s. </p>
<p>Peace,</p>

	    <p>alright alright... simmer down.  It was a fine business meeting.   </p>
<p> i&#39;ll post a livetype tutorial when I get it together.  I figure it&#39;ll be easy for kids and can be great to get them to make lilttle 15 sec transitions between our videos for tv and anything else. </p>
<p> And I have to clarify the workplace.  It&#39;s a great place.  We, the VISTAs are welcomed as staff, but sorta left out on some large scale things.  we&#39;re working on it.  I do get delegated to the front desk during staff meetings, but who wants to hear about the phone chain for snow day procedures?  And I guess we were a bit steaming that day due to another meeting of sorts.  I&#39;ll blog fully about these things later.  </p>

				<p><span>Whoops...so I realized that I haven&#39;t posted the notes from our conference call on 12/8/06.  Here it is 1/7/07 and our next conference call is tomorrow.  My apologies for the delay in posting these.  I promise to be more quick in posting tomorrow&#39;s notes (if you let me!), do a better job, and be more interesting.</span></p>
<p><span>Tim got us started out with a very informative, interesting, and later entertaining, presentation on using on-line collaboration software, specifically Vyew.<span>  </span>He did a better job than I could ever do explaining it in <a href="node/340.html">his blog</a>.<span>  </span>If you haven’t checked it out already, you really should…it’s neat stuff!</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Next up will be Cheryl, who will teach us about having a Disaster Recovery Plan.<span>  </span>No matter what part of the country, or the world, you’re in it’s always important to have a plan, and we look forward to learning how to go about getting that done!</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>We briefly discussed using MySpace for the organizations we’re VISTAs for, but I don’t really remember where that discussion ended up going…any comments/input would be greatly appreciated!</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Next, we did a best of/worst of for November and early December (personally or job-related).<span>  </span>Sorry if any of the details got mixed up or something is listed as happening that didn’t happen that way…feel free to let me know or correct me in any comments! <span> </span>Here’s what people had to offer!</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Best thing that happened:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cheryl</span></strong><span> – She has been interviewing with nonprofits learning a lot about what different organizations do.<span>  </span>Informational interviews are a great way to not only learn about what others do, but a networking opportunity as well!</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Andrea</span></strong><span> – She got a new bike (and helmet)!<span>  </span>Living in a place where she can ride year-round, I’m sure she’ll get great use out of it!</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kamilla</span></strong><span> – <em>I’m sorry, I couldn’t hear anything you said!<span>  </span>If I had thought about it before, I could have emailed you to get your responses, but alas I didn’t.<span>  </span></em></span><em><span><span>L</span></span></em><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Corey</span></strong><span> – Thanksgiving!<span>  </span>It’s Thanksgiving – what is there NOT to love about it!</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Laura</span></strong><span> – She took an HTML class!<span>  </span>What’s big about it is that this is the first computer class that she has <em>ever</em> taken.<span>  </span>Seeing how it seems that most of the other CTC VISTAs have backgrounds in computer or at least technical skills, Laura is on her way to expanding her general technical knowledge…something she honestly never thought she’d do!</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>John</span></strong><span> – During the Thanksgiving holiday, one of John’s favorite moments was seeing the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC.<span>  </span>He’s also glad to be keeping busy with work!</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Jeff</span></strong><span> – Cisco recently donated phone equipment to his organization, which he has been having fun playing with!</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim</span></strong><span> – His boss has been facilitating workshops on Open Data and Open Gov, and Tim has been assisting in the preparation for those workshops. <span> </span><em>I really hope that’s right…I didn’t really understand what you were talking about. </em></span><em><span><span>L</span></span></em><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Worst thing that happened:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cheryl</span></strong><span> – She has also been remotely working on technical assessments for different groups.<span>  </span>She is responsible for writing up the results of questions asked during the assessments, and wants to figure out an efficient way to do this.<span>  </span>Something that could automatically generate results would be great!</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Andrea</span></strong><span> – Along with the joy that the holidays bring comes stress…especially stressing about getting things done before the new year.<span>  </span>Hang in there…it’s almost over! (Or here, rather, by this point.)</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kamilla</span></strong><span> – <em>See above</em></span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Corey</span></strong><span> – She continues to face struggles in working out her loan situation.<span>  </span>It really would be great if she could use her Ed Award when she finishes to help pay off loans!</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Jeff</span></strong><span> – He almost ran over a kid with a U-haul trailer. <span> </span>If you ask me, that would be enough to ruin anyone’s day.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Laura</span></strong><span> – Although she was fortunate enough to go back to Indiana for Thanksgiving, she was unfortunate in the fact that she got sick in doing so.<span>  </span>But I guess that’s what going from sunny, warm San Diego to grey, rainy, chilly Indianapolis will do to ya!</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>John</span></strong><span> – In order to get to DC for his best moment, a 10-hour drive from Boston was required.<span>  </span>Not so fun.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tim</span></strong><span> – One thing he has been working on is improving security for social source commons. <span> </span>The reason for this, however, he is less than thrilled about (understandably). <span> </span>Apparently someone got into and tampered with it.<span>  </span>That’s never a good thing.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Our next call is scheduled for 1/8/2007 (yes, tomorrow/today, but I’m writing this as if I actually posted these on time).<span>  </span>Sorry this turned out kind of long…I hope it was at least was up to par.<span>  </span>Until then!</span></p>

				<p><span>It has truly been a while since I wrote a blog. Anyone who reads Laura&#39;s blogs, however, pretty much knows what I&#39;m doing. My friends here in San Diego call Laura my &quot;life partner&quot; because we spend so much time together - living, commuting, working. Thankfully, we get along and haven’t killed each other yet :)</span><span>. I feel like recently most of my time has been spent in trying to overcome a lot of bureaucracy.  </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Issue #1: Ed Award. I recently discovered that my loan doesn&#39;t necessarily fall into the &quot;qualified&quot; definition of a loan for which an Ed Award can be applied. Apparently, for a loan to be “qualified” it has to be given by the state/federal government. Why then, don’t they say “qualified <em>state/federal </em>loan?” I received a special loan through my school’s alumni association that is interest free so it is considered private. To transfer a loan to a federal one, you have to be currently enrolled in school. Well, had these “qualifications” been explicitly written on the website when I was first looking into AmeriCorps (I was still in school) I might have been able to change it. Instead, however, I joined up and even completed orientation without the slightest inkling that my loan would not be accepted. Thankfully, after a lot of conversations and some letter writing I have been able to get my loan approved. Yae!</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Issue #2: Healthcare. For details on these shenanigans, you should read Laura’s blog. The basic gist – it is pretty much impossible to find a clinic in San Diego. The one clinic listed within 30 miles on Seven Corner’s website is only for children. Believe me, it’s true, we went there twice. How many juveniles are AmeriCorps members? Probably not many. I did look into finding a doctor when I first signed up but never followed through. My bad. Honestly, though, that wouldn’t have helped in Laura’s situation unless they had after-hours, same day appointments available. It is important to be able to go to some sort of 24-hour emergency center and in San Diego, that doesn’t seem to be a possibility with AmeriCorps benefits (not insurance). By the way, downtown inner-city emergency rooms = not so fun. Thank goodness for the Purell dispenser on the wall. I read Danielle’s reply to Laura’s blog and I was absolutely shocked by the advice Danielle had been given, “…show up at the ER and declare you have no insurance - depending on the state, you sometimes get better coverage that way than if you tell them about Seven Corners.” That is so sad. I told Mike Denegal what Danielle said about asking him for advice, he just laughed and said, “I love Danielle :)</span><span>.” </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Now that I’m pretty much done ranting and raving I can tell you all about the things I’ve been up to at Pangea. Pangea is a non-profit software development company that specializes in web-based resident data management tools (I know it’s a mouthful). Our current systems include: AASC Online, AASC Families, Abilities4RSC, and Mercy Families. Here’s a little rundown on what these actually do: The systems are designed for service coordinators (like social workers who live on-site at an elderly home, low-income family housing project, etc). These service coordinators have daily contact with their residents in which they sort of act like a concierge would at a hotel – they provide services for their residents, whatever those might be. These services are provided in hopes that residents can improve their livelihoods and/or become self-sufficient. For example, say Mr. Johnston is living with his family in government-funded, low-income housing and needs to get a job but doesn’t have many skills. The service coordinator could invite him to a computer class that he/she is putting on, set him up to attend someone else’s, or possibly even help him get involved in a degree- or certificate-earning program. Anything she does for him she inputs into one of the systems. Two months later, after finishing his classes, Mr. Johnston lands a great networking assistant job at a local company and is able to move he and his family into an independent apartment building (that is, he no longer requires financial assistance to pay his rent). Well, this outcome is also recorded into the system. So, in the end, the system has recorded the steps the service coordinator took to assist Mr. Johnston in becoming independent. Having it in an electronic format allows the service coordinators to run reports and have tangible proof of the good they are doing. This translates into more government grants and funding for their residences and, therefore, more people helped. To try to keep track of all of this by hand would be mind boggling, whereas the systems can do it in about 5 seconds. </span><span> </span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>So that’s the basic idea, and now you may be wondering, “So what do you do AmeriCorey?” Laura and I have been working on the design of two main information systems: Abilities 4 Mentoring and Abilities 4 Education. Basically we get to design all of the forms and reports from the front-end perspective. The Mentoring system tracks mentoring relationships and their outcomes: Did the mentee’s grades improve? Did he/she stay out of trouble? The Education system is specific to San Diego City Schools and is being built in coordination with a grant given to track AP testing and its effects. The schools want to see if students who take part in programs like AVID or AP classes are more likely to go to college. In addition to these new systems, all of the older systems are constantly being upgraded so we end up doing lots of testing to find the bugs and quirks as well as field tech-support calls. Additionally, we’ve been working on updating training materials for all of the systems.</span></p>
<p><span>By the way, we got a little gift from our buddies at Microsoft. Apparently, this is what half a million dollars looks like:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><img src="http://digitalartscorps.org/files/user963/IMG_0198-compressed.JPG" alt="Microsoft Software" title="Microsoft Software" width="448" height="336" /> </span> </p>
<p><span>Enough about work. One thing I am very excited about is the change from CNET to the NTEN conference. I went to college in LA and I am totally over that city (No offense to true Los Angelens, I just want a change of scenery). I am definitely excited to have some Washington DC adventures: new maps, subways, dead presidents, dollar theaters, the possibilities abound! Oh yeah, and learning at the conference too I guess.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>This blog has become freakishly long. I’m making up for lost time I guess. Anyhow, I hope you all had amazing holidays and are refreshed and ready to get back to saving the world!</span><span> </span> </p>

	    <p>Hey Corey,</p>
<p>My mom has this little saying I say to myself very often in my VISTA service: "Nobody said life is fair."  [I know, it used to piss me off when she said it, but I'm old enough to be ok with the fact that at some point you turn into your parents.] I know for myself, I try to remind myself that the challenges of doing a year of full-time volunteer service are only marginally comparable to the experiences of the people I'm trying to ultimately serve.  Unfortunately we live in a country that doesn't have a national healthcare system and where only a quarter of the population even get a chance to get a 4 year college degree.  I'm not trying to be unsympathetic - I'm admittedly idealist enough to think NOBODY should have to jump through ridiculous hoops to not be sick and get an education. So the system stinks, let's change it.  Let's write some letters. Or help us make it clearer for the next set of VISTAs.  </p>
<p>That being said, I'm impressed with all the amazing stuff your doing at Pangea.  I'd love to keep hearing more often about the great things you're accomplishing this year (and hope you share some of the lessons learned and resourced you developed) and hope you let us know when we can help.</p>
<p>-Danielle</p>
<p>PS Tell Mike D. that I love him right back...him and his positive attitude ;)</p>

				<p><span>I thought I’d share the final results of my adventures in case anyone was interested.<span>  </span>It helps to know what happened first before reading this Part II, so click <a href="node/359.html" target="_blank">here</a> to get caught up before continuing.</span><span> </span><span>Ready?<span>  </span>Okay…</span></p>
<p><span>From work, we (we being Corey &amp; I) left to go back to the first place that we tried in hopes of finding the new location of the clinic.<span>  </span>Upon approaching the door to the place, Corey noticed that the suite number was 150.<span>  </span>Hmmm…150 is supposed to be the suite number for the place I’m looking for.<span>  </span>105 is the suite number for the children’s clinic.<span>  </span>So we think maybe the numbers got swapped and search unsuccessfully for suite 105.<span>  </span>Seven Corners needs to update their search tool.<span>  </span>I ask the receptionist (a different one this time) about it again, who also asks me how old I am, and later recommends that I try the place I was sent the previous day (stop #2).<span>  </span>What to do, what to do…</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>I try calling the number that I have for this mystery clinic and finally get through to someone to ask where exactly they are located.<span>  </span>I find out that the clinic we’ve been searching for the whole time is the children’s clinic…the two clinics that I thought were separate are the same place!</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Since I’m not willing to drive almost 30 miles one-way, I decide that it’s time for my last resort.<span>  </span>Time to hit up the hospital emergency room.<span>  </span>Lucky for me, there’s one with-in walking distance only a block from the apartment, so it was easy enough to find.<span>  </span>Not only is it the smallest ER that I’ve seen, but it’s also the most crowded.<span>  </span>I prepare myself for a long night of waiting, reading <em>A Wrinkle in Time</em> to pass the time until I finally get to see a doctor and get my prescription!<span>  </span></span><span>Almost four hours later, I leave the hospital, swing by CVS (fortunately also within a block), and head home to get some much needed rest.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Now I’m just keeping my fingers crossed that I don’t get some outrageous bill in the mail for my visit in the near future.<span>  </span>That would really be the icing on the cake in this chapter of my life story.</span></p>

	    <p>Hi Laura,</p>
<p>#1 - I hope your feeling better.</p>
<p>#2 - I didn't want you to feel like no one was reading your medical adventures but I don't have much advice for you except, yes, your life would have been much easier if you had "been prepared" and found a doctor when you first got to CA and not wait until you got sick. I found a primary care doctor that does hours at a drop in-clinic, as well as regular appt's so I've never had a problem. This is pretty much true for any job/health "benefts".  </p>
<p>When I asked around Project HQ the only advice would have been to show up at the ER and declare you have no insurance - depending on the state, you sometimes get better coverage that way than if you tell them about Seven Corners.  Isn't  Mike Denegal (former VISTA Leader) still around to ask advice?    </p>
<p>Other than all your medical drama, how's life at work? I'd love to hear about what y'all are working on at Pangea....</p>
<p>-Danielle</p>

				<p>Hey, everybody.  I just wanted to let you all know that I updated my <a href="http://www.kirstenacademy.blogspot.com">Kirsten Academy</a> blog.  I don&#39;t know if any of you are interested, but for the December class, I managed to raise over $450 for charity, and my friends all got a lot of cool art.  Total expenses for me: $15 (a few snacks, and a SASE for an artist who said she probably wouldn&#39;t get around to sending me any art unless I sent her one).</p>
<p> Here&#39;s what you do:</p>
<p>1) Make a lot of friends/ acquaintances (if they are artists, that&#39;s a plus, but it&#39;s not necessary) </p>
<p>2) Tell them you are having an art auction for charity, and that if they want to come, they have to  make and donate some art.</p>
<p>3)  If anybody protests on the grounds that they aren&#39;t artists,  invite them over and help them make something (while making something yourself).  Also, let them know that crafts/clothes/food can count as art.</p>
<p>4) Throw a party/auction!  BYOB!  Bringing snacks is encouraged!  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the auction, I decided to go with a blind/silent format.  Everybody got their own bid sheets, that were numbered 1-50 (each number corresponded to a piece of art).  I also forced everybody to bid at least $1 on EVERYTHING, so that I wouldn&#39;t be stuck with any unwanted art at the end of the day.  And I included a &quot;Spending Limit&quot; box on the bid sheets, so that people could bid high on lots of items without worrying about winning too much, and owing more than they could afford.  </p>
<p>It ended up being a little more complicated to figure out the winning bids this way (it took a couple of hours to make sure that the art was fairly distributed), but it also meant that I was the only person who saw the bids.  So nobody got their feelings hurt.  And it also meant that there were no angry bidding wars.                      Cheap, Fun, and for a Good Cause.  What more could you ask for? </p>

				<p>Being almost four months into my second VISTA term, I&#39;ve never had any trouble utilizing our health benefits...until now.<span>  </span>I&#39;m not an overly-ill person or anything, but I&#39;ve used our benefits a number of times.<span>  </span>During my trip back to Indiana for the holiday, I managed to pick up a simple head cold (which also happened last time I went home, so I&#39;m trying to determine the correlation).<span>  </span>Head colds are no biggie at all, but FLYING with one is no picnic.<span>  </span>As a result, I&#39;ve developed a quite painful ear infection.<span>  </span>All I need is a prescription for the infection. </p>
<p>Since I wasn&#39;t smart enough to follow the advice from PSO and select a doctor when I initially moved here, I didn&#39;t have the luxury of calling him/her up to schedule a quick appointment to stop by and quickly remedy the problem.<span>  </span>So I thought &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll hop online and use the Seven Corners provider search to find out what Urgent Care Centers I can go to and just do that.&quot;<span>  </span>Never did I imagine it would turn into an adventure.<span>  </span>My results yielded two care centers, one of which is pediatric only.<span>  </span>(For comparison purposes, I checked Indianapolis - where I was last year - and got 15 results within a 15 mile radius.)<span>  </span>I called them up to confirm the information listed to discover that the information was indeed wrong, but no big deal - they just relocated their office to the same location where the children&#39;s care center is located. </p>
<p>I left the office a little early so I could beat rush hour traffic and begin my adventure.<span>  </span>We arrived at the address for the care center and ventured inside.<span>  </span>Upon walking in, I noticed that the area was crawling with children (all sick in some way - yuck), so I asked if the clinic served adults.<span>  </span>Nope.<span>  </span>The receptionist asked me how old I was (she probably thought I could have been under 18), so I gave her my answer and she confirmed they couldn&#39;t help me.<span>  </span>I asked her where I could go since I had received information about a care center being located there, and she had no idea what I was talking about.<span>  </span>She did, however, give me the card for a clinic located one block north and advised me to try there.<span>  </span>On to stop #2. </p>
<p>We made the short trip to the second clinic and walked in, ready and prepared to be served.<span>  </span>While signing in, the receptionist asked me if I had an appointment, to which I responded &quot;no.&quot;<span>  </span>(I didn&#39;t think you needed appointments at urgent care centers?)<span>  </span>Turns out I couldn&#39;t be seen because I didn&#39;t have an appointment.<span>  </span>She was nice enough, however, to give me a list of clinics that I could try to see if I had better luck elsewhere.<span>  </span>Moving on... </p>
<p>Before going anywhere, I tried calling some of the clinics on the sheet, only to discover that most required appointments to be seen.<span>  </span>(At that point, I wasn&#39;t even thinking about the issue of whether Seven Corners would cover my expenses or not.)<span>  </span>Since it was nearing 5:00 by then, we gave up and went grocery shopping so we could restock our kitchen. </p>
<p>While at Ralph’s, I explained my situation to the pharmacist and asked if he could provide any advise.<span>  </span>He told me about an urgent care center not far from where we were, although he couldn&#39;t tell me an exact name or address.<span>  </span>Upon arriving home, I went to search for it on the internet, with no luck.<span>  </span>I did, however, have luck finding a place just one block from the apartment that was open until 7:00.<span>  </span>It was 6:17;<span>  </span>I still had time to make it before it closed.<span>  </span> </p>
<p>We took a quick walk across the street, and found the place.<span>  </span>&quot;This is it!&quot;<span>  </span>I thought.<span>  </span>But nope, I was wrong.<span>  </span>The receptionist informed me that she couldn&#39;t verify my &quot;insurance&quot; so I would have to be responsible for any charges for the visit until I could find out if they would be covered.<span>  </span>How much?<span>  </span>&quot;At least $175, but could be $250 or more.&quot; <span> </span>Too much.<span>  </span>I left frustrated and in awe of how complicated this had become.<span>  </span>I would have given up by now and just waited out the infection were it not for the fact that it&#39;s one of the most painful ones I&#39;ve had in a while.<span>  </span>I wake up at night in pain and am constantly reminded of it throughout the day.<span>  </span>So I wasn&#39;t ready to give up. </p>
<p>This morning, I called Seven Corners to find out if they covered any other places that weren&#39;t listed online, specifically the place I had tried the night before.<span>  </span>In a nutshell, the response given to me was &quot;If it&#39;s not online, it&#39;s not covered.&quot;<span>  </span>I mentioned that I had tried the only place listed that I could go with no luck, to which I got, &quot;If there is no where in a 35-mile radius of where you are, you can go anywhere.&quot;<span>  </span>Oh.<span>  </span>So I expanded my search to 40 miles (35 wasn&#39;t an option).<span>  </span>I discovered that there are three places all between 26-27 miles from me...but that&#39;s one way and not exactly close.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In an act of desperation, I tried calling the original place again to re-listen to the recording and noticed the suite number given with the address - 150.<span>  </span>Interesting...the suite number for the children&#39;s clinic (in the same building) is 105.<span>  </span>But you would think they would know about it and would have told me about it when I initially asked...but apparently not.<span>  </span>So today after work, I&#39;m going to try going back to the first building we tried to try to find the clinic.<span>  </span>Wish me luck!!<span>  </span>I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do if this doesn&#39;t work out...maybe I&#39;m just spoiled.</p>

				<p>In May 2007, the Illinois Institute for Entrepreneurship Education (IIEE)  will host the 2007 Youth Entrepreneurship Conference.  Youth will be able to network with other youth entrepreneurs throughout the US, participate in business plan competitions, and attend breakout sessions geared towards business development.</p>
<p> In March of 2006, I had an opportunity to take approximately 20 youth from WYTEC to the E-Place Entrepreneurship Conference in Milwaukee, WI. I believe their attending the conference  was beneficial to the development of our youth.  Youth were able to see how others are taking their talents to write a business plan, market their ideas, and promote a business that has the potential to bring in substantial profits.  One of our youth competed in a Speech Competition and was awarded start up funds for her business, &quot;Baskets by Brittiney&quot;.  Another youth was honored and announced best business at the competition by his peers. His business was &quot;Songs from the Soul,&quot; a neo-soul song writting business.  Our youth, as well as the many youth in attendance, had many unique and creative businesses.</p>
<p>This year our youth will attend the conference here in Illinois and we hope to accomplish great things in our home state.   We will have a youth who is in her last year in grade school present her photography business and another will showcase his song writting business.  We are also taking a group of entrepreneurs who united to for their own t-shirt corporation.  We plan on doing great things this in entrepreneurship this year.</p>
<p>If you are interested in attending the 2007 Youth Entrerepreneurship Conference, you can register on the IlEE website at <a href="http://www.iiee.org/">www.iiee.org</a>.  It is time for our youth to learn that they can be great at being their own boss.</p>

				<p>Does anyone know if there will be an annual CTCNET conference this year? I checked out their website and found two contradictory pieces of information.</p>
<p>One <a href="http://ctcnet.org/what/conference/index.htm">here</a> that says there will be no conference due to strategic planning and one <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/join/support.htm">here</a> that claims there is one and it shall be in LA in June/July.  Talk about contradictory.</p>

	    <p>Carl the powers that be have confirmed that the conference is OFF. In the next few days I'll be sending out an email to VISTAs and supervisors about this since that was the default conference that all CTC VISTAs were expeceted to attend. We will be making the NTEN conference the conference of choice instead. But we are always open to alternatives if people find others that are more in line with their work and interests. --Paul</p>

	    <p>Hey Carl,  </p>
<p> Yes, your org is supposed to cover you going to a conference (see Expectations page - <a href="http://digitalartscorps.org/expectations" target="_blank">http://www.ctcvista.org/expectations</a>).  It used to be the CTCNet conference, but now it&#39;s anyone that you think would be appropriate.  We are going to try and organize groups of VISTAs going together to conferences - it all should be covered in your next monthly conference call.  There will probably be more of the TANP VISTAs at NTEN but there should be a strong showing.  </p>

				<p>When I emerged from my self induced cocoon of Alias Season 4 DVDs and grad school applications this weekend to get some Chinese takeout last night, I stumbled across this <a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/media/articles/2007/01/01/six_in_the_city/" target="_blank" title="Six in the City - Boston Globe 01/01/07">article in yesterday&#39;s Boston Globe</a> while waiting for my egg drop soup:  </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Six in the city: Meet six people whose efforts help make Boston a better place</strong>  </p>
<p>&quot;We ring in the new year with news from the Corporation for National and Community Service that adults in America are volunteering at the highest rate -- 27 percent -- in three decades. And today is a day when many of us resolve to do things to improve ourselves and the world around us. Meet six people whose efforts help make Boston a better place.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow.  A little under three-fourths of our country&#39;s population doesn&#39;t volunteer - this leaves quite a ringing in my ears.  No catchy titles mirroring a HBO series is going to make that factoid any more sexy for me.  And while one of the featured sex...oh I mean six... &quot;volunteers&quot; was a Simmons College student who does community service for work study, none of the folks were VISTAs, let alone AmeriCorps members.  Happy new year every VISTA.   </p>

				<p>I thought I&#39;d give this another go (seriously, I&#39;m only doing it so Danielle will make more of her uber-delicious cookies!).
</p><p>VISTA life has been very up &amp; down (as does non-VISTA life, I suppose) and I&#39;m hoping the ups will outweigh the downs sometime in the very near future. I had a wonderful Christmas and I got to spend time with my Mommy and that was great! I got the 2.0 13.3&quot; MacBook I&#39;ve been dreaming about and it was even more fabulous than I had dreamt...until it got smashed to bits by my psycho-riffic ex-boyfriend who happens to live on the 5th floor of my building (I&#39;m on the 4th).  </p>
<p>November and December were truly a total blur. PTD had a last-minute fundraising event, complete with performers, food, drink and silent auction. This fiasco on wheels (aka &quot;Tis the Season for a Reason...) quickly became the bane of my existence. On the night of the event, after being awake for over 48 hours, my cat died...and that set things in motion for migraines, paper cuts and my not-so-subtle grand jeté into misanthropy...  </p>
<p>Whew! I&#39;m racking my brain trying to reign in the pity-ranting and wrap up this post on a positive note, and I&#39;m just blank. Oh, I know, I&#39;m finally going to sign up for direct deposit after the 1st of the year! Perhaps a career-switch to motivational speaker is in order? </p>

				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>When I learnt that there was going to be a demonstration on collaborative electronic tools at our dec. 6th conference call, I browsed the web to find something that would give me an idea of what <span> </span>a collaborative tool is. <span> </span>I found a concept offered by Google that enable exchange of documents between group members.<span>  </span>They called it “writely”, which allowed me to create a document, the same document my husband could open and edit<span>  </span>from his computer and at his convenience, but not in real time. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Yview seems slightly different. With graphical display and its ability to provide <strong>real time</strong> exchange of screen sharing, in addition to document sharing it is an amazing tool. <span> </span>Tim made a very interesting presentation. Though I had to share the computer with John at the time of demonstration— attept to install software on my own work station failed -- it was a thrilling experience to share the white board with fellow TANs John, Jeff, Andrea, Cheryl, Corey, Laura and Aliya who participated from different locations. <span>Luckily </span><span> </span>I have succeeded installing one on my home computer, and am intending to learn more about it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>I look forward for Laura’s talk on disaster recovery techniques at our next conference call scheduled  to take place on Jan.8th. Also to take the opportunity to say hello to the other members.</span></p>

				<p>Part of my work this year for the CTC VISTA Project is fostering some resource development among the VISTAs.  This is new concept for a project that has mostly focused on just training, supporting, and placing capacity building VISTAs in community and technology centers.  As Paul Hansen mentioned in his Project update <a href="digest/fall06/projecthq_update.html">article in the last Digest</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;It&#39;s because a more focused structure makes it much more feasible for us to provide substantive (priority area specific) support and training to the our VISTAs. And, in a tighter network of VISTAs, members are more likely to support each other in more general ways, as they face the challenges of VISTA service.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a sometimes idealistic VISTA Leader, I see creating resources as just another way to support CTC VISTAs - to not only give the current VISTAs a chance to summarize and exhibit an aspect of their work but also capture that work for the next round.    </p>
<p>Fellow VISTA Leader Ben Sheldon and I have been hashing out both the ideal ways for the VISTAs to collaborate, tempered by the practicality of VISTA life, such as limited time, varying technology skills, and motivation/value of the CTC VISTA network.  It&#39;s a big challenge to build an active community and build the right tools to support it at the same time.  So, we started informally polling VISTAs old and new, by phone, email, and at the MA area meeting.  I appreciated all the responses, especially because they were honest and surprisingly in-depth.</p>
<p>The current blog system was created under the idea that VISTAs would have one point of entry to contribute content to the Project.  The problem with the blog is that it is traditionally a journal of a VISTAs tasks, impressions, and musings over time.  When we encourage people to blog once a month, the entries are often entered out of guilt, contain several different ideas or discussion points, and VISTAs don&#39;t got back to entries to update them if issues evolve.  Even with the addition of tagging, you still need to read through a month&#39;s work of reflection to find one idea.  Plus, blogs are still primarily a one-way / one-to-many communication tool or as Ross put it &quot;communicating by publishing.&quot;  Unless people comment and the author responds, there&#39;s not any two-way collaboration on the ideas.</p>
<p>And these IDEAS is what I&#39;m trying to harvest, chunk, and sort. </p>
<p>So, our newest idea is to create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki" target="_blank" title="Definition of wiki on Wikipedia"><em><strong>wiki</strong></em></a>.  I am a self confessed wiki skeptic.  Yes, I use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, and yes, I trust the content, but the wiki collaboration process seems very techie and wonky from the outside.  Former VISTA Leader, Saul Baizman, created and maintained a wiki for the Project but he was primarily the only person who added anything to it, even among Project HQ staff.    </p>
<p>BUT (there&#39;s always a but..), why do we think a wiki is possibly a good tool for our little resource gathering project?  As usual, Tech Soup has a clairvoyant sense of what I&#39;m wondering about as a community technologist: check out this article, <a href="http://www.techsoup.org/learningcenter/webbuilding/page6031.cfm" target="_blank">Nonprofits Share Their Wiki Success Stories</a>, by Brian Satterfield.    First bit that struck me was the reference to a &quot;wikimaster&quot; - a sort of editor to oversee/maintain the wiki with a &quot;big picture view.&quot; We&#39;ve been talking at Project HQ that some central editor is going to be essential to keep the resource development hopping.  </p>
<p>Second part that caught my eye was the case study of how <a href="http://alzheimerontario.org/">Alzheimer Society of Ontario</a>  rolled out the use of their wiki.  They introduced the wiki technology in person (&quot;...the organization initially got the wiki off to a good start by getting major stakeholders excited about the technology&quot;), then did in-person trainings, online documentation, and Quicktime movie tutorials.</p>
<p>Our idea is to create a mini-working model of how the wiki could work and do a focus group at the PSO in January with new and current VISTA to gauge their reactions to the tool.  I&#39;m hoping to work with Aliya and the other TANP VISTAs to do a survey in the coming months to get opinions as well.</p>
<p>Ben can speak more to the wiki technology options (Drupal module vs. <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediawiki.org%2F&amp;ei=Zz2ARcqtOqPcwQL_5fDuAQ&amp;usg=__JVnnKRhMAo7Q-lo59q79dKSGOc8=&amp;sig2=xtIWztHZWzRsUUp-Tbkmgg" target="_blank" title="Media Wiki">Media Wiki</a> vs. hopping into existing wiki site somewhere), but I&#39;m curious as to how the CTC VISTA community at large feels about resource development and wikis as a tool.  </p>
<p>ANY INPUT IS WELCOME...in fact, more input is exactly what we&#39;re aiming for!  </p>

				<p>I came across the website for the <a href="http://www.freepress.net/conference/">National Conference for Media Reform</a> today; it&#39;s a semin-annual conference, and is coming up on January 12-14 in Memphis, Tenessee. This year&#39;s topics look fascinating: independent/noncommercial media, social justice in media, media activism. They have <a href="http://www.freepress.net/conference/=sessions">mp3s of most of the 2005 sessions</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the topics that looked especially interesting to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wi-fi and Community Internet</li>
<li>Race and Gender in Media Ownership</li>
<li>Building and Sustaining Independent Media</li>
<li>Community and Youth Media</li>
<li>Independent Media as an Organizing Tool</li>
<li>Media Policy is a Civil Rights Issue</li>
<li>Technological Discrimination and the Digital Divide</li>
<li>Organizing Youth to Reform Our Media</li>
<li>Making Media Policy at the Local Level</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ll definitely be listening in and keeping an eye on bloggers&#39; coverage of this.</p>

	    <p>Hi Rebecca and anyone interested:  </p>
<p> Finally a national conference that is not taking place on the east or west coast.  Half of the people at my organization are going and they are thankfully taking me along. </p>
<p>I&#39;ll try to take good notes and collect as many handouts (even from sessions I don&#39;t go to) and hopefully post them.    And I&#39;ll certainly blog about the conference, though a professional blogger ( I can&#39;t believe that&#39;s real) would be much better to read.   </p>

	    <p>I ended up getting a scholarship but I have family obligations that weekend, so luckily they accepted Ben as my stand in.  He's much better at the shmoozing than me anyway.  </p>
