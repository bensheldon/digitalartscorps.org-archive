				<p>Halloween in West Hollywood is analogous to a drag show, frat party and parade all rolled into one.  The bacchanal carousing was quite a sight, and over stimulating to say the least.  Wish I’d taken photos!  At CCTPG, I’ve been making calls to California CBOs about the CTC map I’ve mentioned previously.  Our mapping project takes advantage of Proposition 49, which increased state after-school funding to $550 million and allows all elementary and middle schools to offer after-school programs.  But now that schools have the funding, many don’t have the capacity to start a program, so they are looking to partner with CBOs in their communities to be able to provide programs.    To facilitate this partnering, CCTPG is compiling a list and an Internet-accessible (Google) map of potential partners to share with the schools.  So I’ve been making phone calls and asking organizations’ permission to add them to the map.    Yesterday I also got the chance to go a videoconference CCTPG cosponsored about the California Teleconnect Fund.  It was cool because it brought policymakers and advocates together to dicusss ways to improve the CTF.    You can  view the videoconference and view and participate in a forum about the CTF.</p>

				<p>So I just ran across an interesting site, the <a href="http://lii.org/">Librarian&#39;s Internet Index.</a> As the name suggests, it is an index of websites organized into categories and then subtopics. Each area contains links and short descriptions of relevant, useful websites.  The sites listed have actually been reviewed by librarians and recommended as containing quality information. These aren&#39;t just random Google search results. Seems like this could be a useful research tool, especially for folks working with young people in/outside of schools. </p>
<p>The site also offers a &quot;New this Week&quot; email newsletter. Opening of the Oct. 26 newsletter: &quot;<span class="text">This week grow what you know with websites about elections, Halloween festivities, iron ore, invisibility cloaks, federal spending, spider bites, paper cranes, prisons in the UK, and more. </span><span class="text">Bon appetit from librarians Karen, Wendy, Jennifer, Maria, and Charlotte.&quot;</span></p>
<p> Hmmm...Maybe it&#39;s a little old-school, but I like it. I like it because the hit-or-miss nature of search engines can be frustrating (especially when working with kids!).  And because I think librarians are cool people.   :o) </p>

For those of you who went to this past summer&#39;s CTCNet Conference it is the show of the  closing speaker ( Kojo Nnamdi).  He is a brilliant host and I enjoyed listening to it.

				<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I hope that everyone had a great Halloween! Laura and I followed through on the Chipotle Boo-rito idea and I believe she will have the pics posted in her blog, so check them out! Besides that, work has been picking up quite a bit. It&#39;s nice to feel like I have a place in my organization now. I&#39;m going to give a quick rundown of my most recent tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Training Manual Updates: Basically, taking new screen shots and writing explanations as our systems are constantly evolving. I&#39;m working on the version for the end-users (service coordinators in our case).</li>
<li>Laptop/Desktop Deployment: Setting up laptops for our co-workers to use at conferences for a computer lab they set up as well as for doing demos of the software we develop. </li>
<li>System Testing: We had to check that transfered data was moved correctly from one system to another by spot-checking different residents&#39; info. Also checking that links, titles, content, etc are correct and working within the system.</li>
<li>Software Architecture: Continuing to develop the software for our Mentoring program including building forms, researching inputs and reports and working with the actual program functioning - watching the trainings. These trainings help us to see what kinds of activities go on and help us to make our forms more comprehensive and useful.</li>
<li>Researching for Education project - Our company received a grant to build software for tracking AP and Honors classes/tests in San Diego high schools. The idea is to see if classes like AP, Honors, AVID, etc are adding to students&#39; abilities to succeed (i.e., go to college, get a job, etc).</li>
</ol>
<p>So, that is basically it for me. I&#39;m still working on my loan issues. No one seemed to be able to help. I wrote a scathing letter to my university with a referral from a past professor. Hopefully something will work out :-/. As far as the rest of life, things are going very well. I&#39;ve been playing indoor soccer (highly recommended), going bike riding a ton, and doing some baking. Laura and I went to the Haunted Trail in Balboa Park (near our apartment in San Diego) and got chased by ghouls, goblins and creepsters running with chainsaws - good times. We even rode our bikes to visit this random, self-maintained topiary garden a few miles from our apartment. Some person turned their entire yard into a zoo full of topiary animals. Pretty nifty. Anyway, hope all is well!</p>

				<p>Greetings!  I hope you all had a safe and fun Halloween!  I hope everyone checked out Corey&#39;s most recent blog, <a href="node/244.html" target="_blank">Free Food Alert!!!</a> and some of you took the opportunity to get free food while having fun.  Last night, Corey and I did just that, dressing up as burritos and heading to Chipotle for free ones (estimated value between $7-$8).  Afterwords, we decorated sugar cookies and watched the Nightmare Before Christmas.</p>
<p>I&#39;m working on how to get the pictures up.  I&#39;m not a Flickr fan, and apparently you can&#39;t just post photos directly into a blog.  I&#39;ll keep working on it; as a last resort, I&#39;ll just post them to what I use for photos (Picasa), but I want it to be easier than that.  We&#39;ll see.</p>
<p>I know that none of this has to actually do with technology or my service directly, but it&#39;s VISTA Life and a prime example of how you can have fun on a VISTA budget!</p>
<p>In service,</p>
<p>Laura</p>

				<p>Everyone on the CTC VISTA listserv probably noticed some extra e-mail today.  Thanks for taking me into your inboxes, and thank you to Matt and Dina for some solid advice!</p>
<p>One of my ongoing projects is creating a website for the UMass Lowell Engineering Service-Learning Program, affectionately known as SLICE (Service-Learning Integrated throughout the College of Engineering).  I&#39;ve been working on the site sporadically for about six months, having done most of the work in February and March.  Now that the school year has started, it&#39;s time to bring the site online.  That means debugging.</p>
<p>It might have been easier if I had used a content-management system for the site, or at the least, used a pre-canned template for the site design.  I&#39;m one of these people who likes to do things himself, however, and sometimes I take this to a fault.</p>
<p>I decided to go whole-hog and code the entire site from scratch.  Considering that the SLICE folks just wanted a new look for their existing site (which used frames rather poorly), all I had to do was create a template page and type in some text, right?  Indeed.</p>
<p>For me, coding a site from scratch means using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for as much of the styling and layout as possible.  I avoid using tables to position my pages.  Here&#39;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a single CSS file for layout makes changing pages go more quickly than using tables, inline attributes (e.g., &lt;div align=&quot;&quot;&gt;) and &lt;font&gt; tags.</li>
<li>CSS allows me to simply use a different stylesheet to create printer-friendly pages, screen-reader-friendly pages, and compact pages for handheld PCs and cell phones.</li>
<li>One 5k CSS file services an entire site, meaning that pages will load faster.  For people with broadband connections, this isn&#39;t a big issue.  For dial-up users, size and speed are tightly correlated. </li>
</ul>
<p> The use of CSS instead of tables, &lt;font&gt; tags, and inline attributes, along with the use of descriptive &quot;class&quot; and &quot;id&quot; attributes, is commonly referred to as semantic markup, and is a hot-button issue with web designers.  The logical conclusion of this would be to design pages using XML, so that you could have a tag called, for example, &quot;&lt;linkmenu&gt;.&quot;  We&#39;re not quite there yet. </p>
<p> The advantages of CSS-based design over traditional design are so persuasive that everyone would design pages this way, right?  Not so.  Every browser has its own way of interpreting both HTML and CSS, which makes for a trying experience sometimes.  Thus people choose to use the traditional methods of web design, involving tables, &lt;font&gt; tags, and inline attributes.  At the Grassroots Use of Technology Conference this past June, Ben DiMaggio referred to this difference in design philosophy as the &quot;holy war&quot; in web design.</p>
<p>Taking sides has its drawbacks.  For the SLICE site, I wanted to create a simple two-column layout, with a banner across the top and copyright info across the bottom.  The left column should be a fixed width so that people didn&#39;t have the navigation links resize whenever they resized their browser windows.  The right column should allow for browser resizing, at least down to a reasonable amount (say 400-500 pixels) .  A fixed-width navigation column next to a variable-width main column?  Simple.  Just use CSS&#39;s &quot;float&quot; attribute.  Except that this doesn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 5 and 6 don&#39;t float things very well.  If you decide to have a floating left column full of links, things get goofy if you specify any heights or widths in your right column.  Woe unto those who like using background images: borders and background images don&#39;t play nicely when floated in Internet Explorer.  There&#39;s a funny-looking &quot;indent&quot; if your right column is longer than your left column.</p>
<p>I tried and tried to solve this with the float attribute, but never with much luck.  Either I had to create &lt;div&gt; containers upon &lt;div&gt; containers, which is just as bad, markup-wise, as using tables for layout, or I had to change my CSS.  I chose the latter.</p>
<p>With the &quot;position&quot; attribute, CSS lets you position things exactly, down to the pixel.  Since my left column was of a fixed width, I just decided to place the main body of the web page next to the links column.  The strange indent bug was gone in Internet Explorer, but now Firefox was leaving a strange gap at the right of the page.  Since IE still holds the lion&#39;s share of browser usage these days, I was happy.  Since Mozilla-based browsers have a good 15% share of browser usage, my solution wasn&#39;t good enough.  In came the listserv.</p>
<p>Matt and Dina graciously offered their help: Matt suggesting that I look at my Document Type Definition (DTD), and Dina offering some tricks with the float attribute that I hadn&#39;t thought of.  Not quite the right track.  Finally, after a few wrong turns, one extra attribute fixed things:</p>
<p>&lt;code&gt;right: 0;&lt;/code&gt;</p>
<p>Ten bytes!!!  All this work to change ten bytes!  And really a fairly intuitive answer: if I specify the leftmost edge of my main column, I might as well specify the rightmost edge also.  Most web designers know that a &lt;div&gt; tag expands to fill up the entire width of its containing element.  Do they know about this particular exception?  I hope so, but I sure didn&#39;t.</p>
<p>In addition to the &quot;right: 0;&quot; fix, today I learned about the &quot;Holly Hack,&quot; a workaround for Internet Explorer to keep content from disappearing when a page is loaded.  Fortunately, learning about this was a 30-minute &quot;read and imitate&quot; fix.</p>
<p>And there&#39;s still more to learn.  Evidently the CSS specifications changed slightly between CSS 2.0 and CSS 2.1.  And I&#39;m still not up to date with Mac IE and Safari.  My position often forces me to be a &quot;John of all trades,&quot; so I sacrifice some depth of knowledge for breadth.  Guess that means that in the web design &quot;holy wars,&quot; I&#39;d better not get too holy, because I don&#39;t know everything.</p>

				<p>Let&#39;s see.....what&#39;s new?  </p>
<p>Well, my foodstamps finally kicked in, which I was so excited about that I blew nearly the entire amount in one monster shopping trip.  I even went so far as to purchase some smoked sausage for breakfast, which I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had in 10 years.  And I&#39;m not talking about those crappy little sausage links that look all gray and shriveled.  I&#39;m talking <em>real</em> sausage.  Made from magical pig aristocrats, from the pig Social Register.  So that&#39;s pretty good.</p>
<p> My job finally started getting interesting.  I&#39;ve gone to a good number of schools and after-school programs and youth programs now.  I&#39;ve worked with everybody from 6th graders to 19-year-old homeless kids.  And the movies that the kids are making have been turning out really well.  Maybe I&#39;ll post some examples when we get them completed.  </p>
<p>In my free time, I am not dating.  That is because I have no time or money for girls. So if somebody knows of a resource where I can meet girls who are both fast and cheap, please let me know.                    </p>
<p>Yes, that was a joke.  And yes, it was funny.</p>
<p>Due to my lack of funds, I have had to come up with cheap forms of entertainment.  One of these has been to start a band.  This has been a lot of fun, and not as expensive as one might think.  For instance, I have plans to build an electric guitar out of a cigar box.  And I checked out a video from the library called &quot;How To Make Your Own Musical Instruments&quot;.  I am building a tub bass, a mouth bow, and a dulcimer.  If anybody else wants to start a band on the cheap, let me know.  Perhaps we could collaborate on a cross-country song of some kind (which is exactly what my <a href="http://www.publicparasites.blogspot.com">SunTribe</a> blog is intended for).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also started a <a href="http://www.kirstenacademy.blogspot.com">continued education</a> program, with the help of a few friends.  It&#39;s a good way to learn new things, hang out with friends, meet new people, and have fun on the cheap.  If anybody has any questions about that, or would like to start their own satellite KirstenAcademy, please let me know.  </p>
<p>Okay, that&#39;s it for now.  Catch ya on the flipside.</p>

<p>I laughed at your fast/cheap girl joke. Girlfriend taxes are expensive ;). The Kristin Academy looks really awesome. Is that only an Oregon thing or is it all over? Do we have to start our own? I&#39;m not too creative.</p>

				<p>Hey Everybody!</p>
<p>I just wanted to tell you all about this fun/free Halloween opportunity. I did it last year and it was a total blast. Basically, at Chipotle (really good burritos - is it only a West Coast chain?) if you dress like any of their menu items (using tinfoil) on Halloween, they&#39;ll give you a free burrito!!! My friends and I misunderstood and just dressed in tinfoil - Chip n&#39; Dale dancer, Jailbird, Angel, Baby, etc. It was way fun and funny. Plus, what cheaper costume can you get than a roll of tinfoil? Anyway, hope everyone is doing well. Happy Halloween!</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to make a little video over the weekend to brush up on my Final Cut Express skills, but here&#39;s a lil preview photo of an exhibit I saw in the public library in the North End, made by the most amazing woman named Yolanda.  She&#39;s been bringing this growing exhibit about the culture of Latin countries around Dia De Las Muertos (the Day of the Dead).  The great thing about it is that it all started as a way to teach her local police officers not to fear going into Latino houses with these types of decorations as &quot;devil worshipers.&quot;  It&#39;s all about making community change by distilling fear and ignorance, people.   </p>

				<p>Hey Everyone,</p>
<p>I &#39;ve really missed writing to you guys. First let me say the new changes look good. It is also informative.  At the Pink House we are working on a Electronic post card for the children at the Center. They are simply wonderful. The children are in touch with children from all over the world.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think there are enough hours in the day to do everything that is required to make things happen. The kids are totally great! The staff I&#39;m working with totally open to the new changes we are putting in place. Oh yeah, we have a new Chief of Police and the community is totally excited about that. </p>
<p>The neighborhood awareness of what&#39;s happening at the Pink House is making a name for us. The community comes to us with questions, comments, and participation in our projects. The electronic post cards are just one of the different techy things we have going on at the PINK HOUSE.</p>
<p>Well off I go to work!</p>
<p>Great Blogging with ya!</p>
<p>Renae out</p>

				<p>Hey everyone, here&#39;s a quick update on some things at UMass. </p>
<p>With the Digest deadline quickly approaching, Danielle and I are working to get articles, bios, images, and video up in Drupal.  If you wrote an article and have a photo that’s relevant, it would be great if you could send it to me or let me know where I can find it.  It will be interesting to see how the Journal works as a finished product in the context of our new site. The Digest has been great because it’s allowed me to see a little more of Drupal and also created an appeal for web based documents and spreadsheets, neither of which I’d given any prior thought. I’ve been using Google’s versions and for my purposes they’ve been just as functional and easy to navigate as Excel or Word.</p>
<p>I’ve also been doing some outreach for the Project, researching local Community Media and Technology (or similar) programs to get involved with. Our aim is to strengthen both the university programs and the Project by sharing connections and resources and providing opportunities relevant to each other’s members. For example, people in these programs are presumably great applicants for the CTC VISTA Project and often these universities offer graduate programs that would be of interest to VISTA members. I’m going to be taking a series of workshops in November with Nettrice Gaskins at MassArt on InDesign so I can get some tangible materials together for some face-to-face meetings.</p>
<p>On the organization side of things, I’ve been searching for non-profits that could potentially use a VISTA in Detroit, MI. Recently, we’ve had more applicants interested in working in Detroit, but the Project doesn’t currently work with anyone there, and as I’m from the Metro Detroit area I was excited to do this.  If anyone working in or from Michigan has any thoughts, let me know.  </p>
<p>Hope everyone enjoys the weekend.</p>

				<p>Well it&#39;s been a little while so it&#39;s time for an update. I can&#39;t believe that it&#39;s almost Halloween...time flies.</p>
<p> So I&#39;m loving life in Berkeley at Center for Digital Storytelling. I&#39;m finally feeling more like I&#39;m a part of things here...I&#39;ve got an email address, business cards, and they even put me on the <a href="http://www.storycenter.org/people.html">website</a>. Yay! I&#39;m also getting deep into projects, which feels good.  </p>
<p> I&#39;ve been helping lead our digital storytelling workshops and then doing postproduction work on the stories produced. It&#39;s really awesome work because basically once or twice a month I get to sit down with a group of people, listen to them tell their stories, and then help them carry out their vision of how to present the story as a digital media project. The whole workshop process is amazing...I think it&#39;s rare when people sit down to really listen to each other. Beyond just opening up and sharing stories, there&#39;s the creative aspect of planning how best to present your story and then using these really cool tools to bring the story to life with images and music. I&#39;m still really drawn in to the magic of it. Three cheers for participatory media!</p>
<p> One of the coolest things about my work here is seeing how digital stories can be used for social change. We do a lot of work with community based organizations, training them to be able to use digital stories in their work to address issues in their own communities. I think it&#39;s great to see this stuff put to work instead of just looking at it as a jazzy way to preserve personal memories. </p>
<p>Okay, well this post is getting lengthy. I could gush about this forever but I&#39;ll stop. I promise to post some really links/questions/helpful info sometime soon! </p>

				<div>Firefox is currently the most popular (<a href="http://socialsourcecommons.org/tool/by_popularity">http://socialsourcecommons.org/tool/by_popularity</a>) tool in  SSC, so it&#39;s pretty big news that Firefox 2.0 was released yesterday.  I updated  my version yesterday afternoon and so far it&#39;s been working great for me.  More  importantly, I haven&#39;t noticed any problems with SSC since I&#39;ve been using it,  although I will still be doing more testing.</div>
<p> 
<div>Along with the launch of Firefox 2.0, there has been an increase in  activity among blogs and bookmarking sites listing add-ons for Firefox, most of  which I&#39;ve encorporated in Firefox&#39;s Useful Links field (<a href="http://socialsourcecommons.org/tool/show/51/support">http://socialsourcecommons.org/tool/show/51/support</a>).</div>
</p><p> 
<div>Most add-ons can be found through Firefox&#39;s website (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/">https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/</a>).  In particular,  Firefox&#39;s website has a list of recommended add-ons (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/recommended/">https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/recommended/</a>).  I&#39;ll be  exploring a few of these for my personal use.  So far, I&#39;ve been using Sage (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/77/">https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/77/</a>) as my RSS reader  and Google&#39;s Browser Sync (<a href="http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/">http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/</a>) so that I  can use the same bookmarks on both my home and work computers.</div>

	    <p>hmm, i wonder if my extension-thing (made from a greasemonkey script) still works. this is a good illustration of how people release open source software because they wanted something cool and so they made it but then they lose interest or get too busy to keep updating it. i wonder how many developers feel guilty about not keeping up with their software. i guess it is better to have had good software and have lost it than to never have had it at all. :p </p>

				<p>At this summer's CTCnet Conference the thing I most took away--or rather, repeated to the most number of people--was something said by the keynote speaker, Ami Dar, the creator of Idealist.org.</p>
<p>He was asked by someone in the crowd something along the lines of "In what areas do you want to see nonprofits develop into the future?"</p>
<p>Ami Dar responded that an area that he saw as important was <strong>acknowledgement of nonprofit competition</strong>.  His brilliant reasoning was this:</p>
<blockquote><p>In for-profit companies, everyone accepts that competition takes place; it's a given.  Businesses identify the areas in which they compete, and from this, also gain an understanding of the areas in which they <em>don't</em> compete. In the areas in which they don't compete, businesses can cooperate.  Nonprofits, in general, are not aware of, or acknowledge that they compete (and they do), and because of this, they cannot collabrate as efficiently or as effectively as possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>My own example of this is the Detroit automakers.  Ford and GM are incredibly competitive in car production, features, pricing, dealerships, etc.  But at the same time, they have an incredibly strong combined lobby for setting safety and emission standards, things that affect the entire industry.  They know where they compete and therefore know where they can work together.</p>
<p>So this has been rattling around in my head until I read two things:</p>
<p>This first was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learning-How-Learn-Joseph-Novak/dp/0521319269/sr=8-1/qid=1161788036/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-3768589-3995934?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">"Learning How to Learn" by Joseph D. Novak, D. Bob Gowin, and Jane Butler Kahle</a>, which lays out some very interesting models and heuristics for visualizing information.</p>
<p>The second was <a href="http://www.sauder.ubc.ca/faculty/research/docs/weinberg/ISM_2000.pdf">A Typology of Nonprofit Competition: Insights for Social Marketers</a> by Robin J. Ritchie and Charles B. Weinberg.</p>
<p>Putting them together, I made this using OmniGraffle:</p>

				<p>The recent (2006) announcement that the Nobel Peace prize has been won by Dr. Muhammad Yunus has caught my attention.  Part of the prize is shared by a banking system called Grameen bank.</p>
<p>The bank is supposedly working on the principles of community effort, mutual <br />trust, accountability, and micro credit.  It is designed to offer small  <br />loans to poor people in groups of 5, who are otherwise not credit worthy. <br />The primary requirement for loan eligibility seems to be collective <br />accountability of groups to repay. Because there is no requirement to back their loans <br />with collateral,  the poor have been able to invest in some trade for their livelihood.  </p>
<p>The conditions for loan have helped improve social and economic awareness. </p>
<p>This system appears to have uplifted and improved the lives of many poor <br />communities in Bangladesh, among whom a big percentage is said to be women. This indeed is a system of community, networking and collective effort that has not only made a success story but also has received a distinguished recognition.</p>

	    <p>Hey Kamala,</p>
<p> We actually watched a video on Dr. Yunus at our VISTA Leader training over the summer!  They used him as an example of a leader thinking out of the box to fight poverty.  I think it was a PBS special, narrated by Robert Redford.  There&#39;s a bunch of videos of him on <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5345109740625654987&amp;q=Yunus" target="_blank">Google Video</a> and a whole bunch of stuff on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.  Very inspiring.</p>

				<p>For a while now I've really been wanting to write a primer and checklist for nonprofits who are thinking about implementing a CMS.  Fortunately, patience is always the best facilitator as someone (<a href="http://commonknow.com">Common Knowledge</a>) has done it for me already:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><a href="http://www.commonknow.com/reports/selecting_a_content_management_system.html">Selecting a Content Managment System</a></strong></p>
<p>This report provides and overview of Content Management Systems (CMS) designed to support non-profit organizations. It offers insights on the definition of a content management system, outlines how they are valuable for a non-profit organization, and what criteria to consider when purchasing and implementing a Content Management System. Further, it details how to efficiently develop a Request for Proposal (RFP) and how to calculate a budget for your project. Lastly, it lists the vendors to consider when purchasing a CMS. </p></blockquote>
