				<p>Working with teenage youth typically is not the easiest task, especially when youth is labeled with negative stereotypes because of the neighborhood they live in.  I&#39;ve been working at the Westside Youth Tech Entrepreneur Center for over a year now and it is in one of the most underserved communities in Chicago.  These teenagers have been labeled as misfits who are destined for one of the many prisions in Illinois; however, there is a negative misconception about the teenagers on the Westside of Chicago, because all of them are not casting black shadows on their community.</p>
<p>I have youth here who are creating music videos using Vegas.  I have youth here who are developing mixtapes using professional grade studio equipment and marketing their music.  There is one teen here who is developing a video game using software I can&#39;t seem to figure out.  The ideas are constantly flowing through these young teens and is trickling down to the even younger children who look at these teenagers as sources for more knowlege.  They look at situations and circumstances from a different perspective, a more positive one than most who visit their community do.  </p>
<p>I am witnessing a wonderful change within the minds of the youth here at WYTEC; youth who will one day grow to become the politicians, business owners, and community leaders who will change the stigma of the Westside of Chicago being the worst place in Illinois to be.  I am glad that through the VISTA program, I have been given the opportunity to work with these youth.  I am honored that I have inspired some of these youth to learn new technologies and develop their inner talents.  I await the day when the Garfield Park community is transformed into one of the best, not worst, neighborhoods to visit.</p>

<p>DId anyone catch Moyers on America last week on PBS?   It was called &quot;The Net at Risk&quot;, very informative.  Starts off with what the phone and cable companies promised to do in the 90s with the fiber optic networks.   Then proceeds into the net neutrality issue and a whole slew of metaphors to describe the internet and what the phone/cable companies / congress / fcc may do.  </p>

				<p>It&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve done the blog thing.... </p>
<p>My progress with starting a youth channel and youth media program at my access center:</p>
<p>slow.   slow.  and lacking direction.   Though on the bright side, i&#39;ve got good resources, there are several kids interested, some organizations interested in partnering, and promised youth programming on the way.  </p>
<p>To start with, I made a list of most of the youth media programs/access centers with youth programs from around the country.  If anyone wants that list, let me know.   </p>
<p>I contacted individuals from several organizations and recieved some replys.  I contacted Appalshop - (super media program and art collective in Appalachia, I think Eastern Kentucky) - and had a phone meeting with the woman who runs their youth media program  (Appalachian Media Insititute).   She gave some great advice for starting a program -  you can&#39;t be everything.   Geez oh peet that seems so obvious.  Here I am, being ideailistic about all the great things a youth media program can do and trying to encororate everything.   So I&#39;m working on hashing out some goals, hopeful outcomes and trying to determine the purpose of this youth media channel venture.  </p>
<p>As for getting content - that&#39;s been another challenge.  At media bridges we&#39;ve got some cute things the summer media camp kids made.  And we&#39;ve got some Media that Matters Film Fest films to play.   I&#39;ve contacted a few organizations to ask for content and nothing too concrete yet.  </p>
<p>On the plus side - I went to <a href="http://www.archive.org" target="_blank" title="archive.org">archive.org</a>  (super super super site) and they have a youth media section including BAVC and ListenUp!   I found a pleasant lil claymation bit called &quot;Pizza Math.&quot;  I contacted the organization who made it, and they&#39;ll be sending me a free dvd of their work!  yay!   success!   </p>
<p>It&#39;s going, it&#39;s going.  Like pudding down a slide.   </p>
<p>I hope didin&#39;t come off as sounding defeated and all that - I love it here.  Go community media!    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ps - for any talking heads fans out there, i just heard two great covers - the arcade fire doing home and built to spill covering dream operator from true stories.  find it !  </p>

	    <p>Hey, Lauren.  Have you contacted anybody at the NYMAP Video Exchange yet?  Portland Community Media just signed on with them, to form a five-station youth media exchange thing.  The website is still in the works, and we won&#39;t get the equipment for a while, but it sounds pretty sweet.  I know they aren&#39;t accepting any core partners at this time, but you should look into Media Bridges becoming a secondary partner.  If you haven&#39;t already, you should contact Andrew (<a href="mailto:andrew@youthchannel.org">andrew@youthchannel.org</a>) to find out more.</p>
<p> Also, where please may I find these talking heads covers, as I am a big fan of all three bands in question.   </p>

	    <p>I&#39;ve contacted Andrew about the digi distr before but nothing concrete has happened yet.  I wouldn&#39;t mind getting in as a secondary.   Media Bridges has some youth produced stuff, but it&#39;s not produced on a regular enough basis - I&#39;m working on that.   We just got a new digital playback system and we&#39;ve got servers and satellite thingers and the fast macs, so I&#39;d like to utilize that and join the network.  </p>
<p>Thanks for the advice, I&#39;ll email him again and ask if I can get in on that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the covers --- those came from torrent sites, so check your favortie file sharing community (i think these came from dimeadozen.org and oink.me.uk.- if you need an invite, let me know).  The built to spill was a show in 2001, I think.  And the arcade fire was recent.... david byrne was at the show and did it with them.  If you can&#39;t get a hold of them, I&#39;ll get the torrents up somewhere common or i can just send you a cd.  Email me.   My bf is working on an obscure  covers project, so if you&#39;ve got any or are interested in the final product let me know.  I&#39;m trying to convince to make it into a podcast.   wwhewwww.   that&#39;s a long tangent not related to anything vista like..         </p>

	    <p>Hey Lauren,</p>
<p>Last year <a href="http://www.nettrice.us/ed_materials.html" target="_blank">Nettrice Gaskins</a> presented at the PSO on how to start a youth media program.  She&#39;s got a guide from the DAY program that she is willing to share by email with CTC VISTAs with lots of great resources.  Also, check out the article and resources in the last issue of the ComTechReview <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/fall-2005/000370.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also (hopefully) going to be a new VISTA starting in January in Atlanta at People&#39;s TV doing the same thing you&#39;re trying to do (start a youth channel) so I&#39;l connect you guys too. </p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;ve been spending much of my time recently having fun with RSS. Much of what I&#39;m doing is searching for information around the web that I can aggregate onto Social Source Commons, and naturally blogs are very helpful to this task, as are the official websites for the tools.  I&#39;ve also been signing up for Google Alerts, and getting e-mail whenever a new hit on Google results for my search terms. </p>
<p>Since I&#39;ve been using Firefox primarily, I downloaded Sage and have been using that.   It seems to work fairly well, but I&#39;d be interested in hearing what other RSS readers people are using.  </p>

				<p>So, I have completely let this blog go by the wayside.  For shame.  But I&#39;m back, baby, although I still refuse to like blogs.</p>
<p>So, whats been happening with your friendly neighborhood wireless guy? Well, its been so ridiculously busy lately, that I was able to completely ignore something like an online web log without a second thought. Woohoo!</p>
<p>Yes, we have a working wireless mesh network now. For the past month and a half we&#39;ve been frantically trying to setup all of the residents who signed up initially, back in January of this year. So you can understand why they might be in a hurry to get their internet access. In the past couple months we&#39;ve installed routers in about 70 or so homes, which is only half of our expected number of users, but believe me, the other 70 people have been banging down our door asking for internet. Except that when we try to call them and setup an appointment, they don&#39;t pick up the phone. They do show up at the tech center, upset that we haven&#39;t called them, though. Ah well. At least we&#39;ve made a good amount of progress in a short time, and I can no longer claim that my job description is a liar. This is what I signed up for. Oh, by the way, its the best job ever.</p>
<p>And in the midst of all this wifi installation and subsequent tech support, which pretty much consumes all of my time, we&#39;re trying to dole out money to other housing developments in the Boston area that are interested in Wifi - part of Castle Square&#39;s grant was 15000 dollars to support other housing developments in their wifi implementation. We are holding an open house on the 8th of November to show interested groups around our site and explain the grant process to them. I&#39;m also going to be the chair of the committee that decideds who gets the money, and how much money they should get - we&#39;re hoping to have some pretty smart people on the committee though, so I won&#39;t be the one who actually has to decide anything. What do I know?</p>
<p>One last thing - we&#39;re starting our computer refurbishing program with big goals. At least, I have big goals, but we&#39;ll have to see how it goes. We want to supply residents of Castle Square, and the South End, with computers, on a basis of need. Currently we only have some 30 computers that have been donated from Boston Latin Academy, but we&#39;re always looking for more so if you know anything, get at me. I&#39;m hoping that Castle Square can actually turn this into a business and become a low cost computer reseller for the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Thats whats been happening. Ok, I gotta run, I have a user who can&#39;t access his email waiting for me at his apartment, and 3 other computers that are full to the brim with malware sitting behind me, sadly watching the shiny new lab computers with envy in their eyes.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/sushla/" title="Check out Sushla&#039;s Flickr photos"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/91/245404847_91acf067ab_m.jpg" alt="John Mayer by Susheela (Flckr.com)" title="John Mayer by Susheela (Flckr.com)" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="240" height="160" align="right" /></a>Dear Mr. Mayer,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been a fan of your songwriting and style for quite a while.  I&#39;ve persisted in this admiration even in the face of people calling you a &quot;sell-out&quot;, your experimentation with new genres, and your screaming female co-ed fan base.  Many times, I&#39;ve marveled on how well you articulated moments of behavior and feelings around growing as a post college adult and finding a purpose in the world.  I tend to actually pay for your albums and listen to what you have to say, as do millions of other people.  In this way, I&#39;ve become a consumer of both your goods and your philosophy.</p>
<p>But I am also an activist.  I believe every person has a story and deserves to be heard.  I speak out for what I believe, but I also made a now two-year commitment an <a href="http://www.americorps.gov/about/programs/vista.asp" target="_blank">AmeriCorps VISTA</a> (Volunteers In Service to America) to actually take action to support my beliefs as well.  And while I try to read and listen to as many voices as I can to both support and challenge my beliefs, the one voice I refuse to give audience is one of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apathy" target="_blank">apathy</a>.</p>
<p>In my work as a VISTA (especially with my placement this year with the housing developments of Boston and Massachusetts), I&#39;ve listened to many types of voices: voices of fear of walking down a street to participate in GED programs because of gang violence; voices of anger around misrepresentation in the media; voices of exhaustion about the powerlessness caused by bureaucratic systems and ignorance of opportunity.  Many of these voices are not heard beyond the walls of small community centers, church basements, or under funded technology programs, and certainly not in the mainstream media or on the floor of Congress.  And I have to admit there were moments in the past couple weeks where I was shocked that people were hesitant to share their voice with me because of who I am and where I come from.</p>
<p>Here’s why I’m writing to you.  Your song &quot;<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnmayer/waitingontheworldtochange.html" target="_blank" title="John Mayer Lyrics">Waiting on the World to Change</a>&quot; angers me - not because I disagree when it calls out an unpopular war, media bias, or corporate owned media content, but because its proposed solution is to abide.  I&#39;m glad you “care” and have awareness that “the fight ain’t fair.”  But I’m discouraged to hear that you know these things, but have chosen to use your far-reaching voice to encourage our shared generation to merely “wait” for it all to blow over until power comes to us by default.  </p>
<p>While working with non-profits, I’ve encountered a surprising fear of change in the way we do things, even though our missions is often to exact change in other institutions, systems, and individuals.  In the face of such stoicism, some fellow VISTAs have expressed frustration and say “why doesn’t that older generation just loosen up a bit or let us take the lead?”  In our role of building capacity in the war against poverty and disempowerment in one short year, there’s no room for VISTAs to wait for the voice of the people we serve to be heard.  We’re not volunteers in <em>waiting</em> for America.  We’re “standing at a distance” from the sources of funding and power in our communities, but we’re trying to improve the system and enact change NOW because the need is not always in the far off future</p>
<p>So every “we” uttered in your song angers me, because you purport to represent my fellow VISTAs and I…and you don’t.   If you feel misunderstood, Mr. Mayer, then I’d wish you’d turn your writing talent and power to reach millions of listeners toward highlighting the work of few who are trying to empower people to make change, if you’re not willing to do it yourself.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>Here are some resources that I hope you find useful!  The first site is more comprehensive, while the last three focus on volunteerism.  I have more resources related to other topics, but I&#39;ll save those for another day.  :)</p>
<p><strong>ETR Associates Epicenter</strong> <a href="http://www.nationalserviceresources.org/" target="_blank">www.nationalserviceresources.org</a> - This site, developed by the Corporation for National and Community Service, lists best practices for a variety of topics.  AmeriCorps members submit what worked for them, so their experiences are easy to relate to.  If you click on the AmeriCorps logo, you can search by topic area, such as Education, Human Needs, Program Management, and Volunteer Management to name a few.  I found it to be useful during my previous VISTA term when I wasn&#39;t sure where to start on a certain task. </p>
<p><strong>Point of Light Foundation</strong> <a href="http://www.pointsoflight.org/" target="_blank">www.pointsoflight.org</a> - Under the &quot;Resources&quot; tab, there are a variety of publications, examples, and tool kits for those managing volunteers.  The downside is that there&#39;s no easy way to search for something specific; the best way to find something is to sort the list alphabetically and hope to find what you&#39;re looking for that way if you don&#39;t have time to look through everything.  Lots of good resources, however. </p>
<p><strong>Volunteer Today</strong> <a href="http://www.volunteertoday.com/">www.volunteertoday.com</a> - Pretty much a one time visit to the website to subscribe, Volunteer Today is an electronic newsletter for people who manage volunteers.  Although generally not really indepth, it can be useful for those new to the task.</p>
<p><strong>VolunteerMatch</strong> <a href="http://www.volunteermatch.org/">www.volunteermatch.org</a> - This is an awesome website, used to find volunteer opportunities and volunteers.   It really speaks for itself, so if you&#39;re looking for volunteer opportunities in your community or are trying to recruit volunteers, check it out!</p>

				<p>I had the opportunity to attend a workshop in Springfield, MA. yesterday (october 18) and was very impressed by the speaker.  The subject was guerrila marketing, and he was so fast and able to communicate key items in a very limited amount of time that before I knew it 2 hrs. had flown by.  I have to get sponsors for our newly launched website and I have never been &quot;trained&quot; in how to do that.  The workshop entitled &quot;Intro to guerrilla marketing&quot; was offered to the Massachusetts small business development center network by The Steady Sales Group/J. Sheldon Snodgrass of 89 South St. , Williamsburg MA 01096  and he was impressive in that he was so on point about the info given. There was hardly time for in depth interaction, but we came away with a workbook that we could do our own study with.  So glad to have been able to attend.  I&#39;ve been a wee bit nervous about the cold calling I need to do, but my background of 40 yrs. as a hairdresser alllows me a certain amount of comfort because I&#39;ve been dealing with the public for so long.  It&#39;s always GOOD to get some further training anyway.</p>
<p>Today I was invited to attend a luncheon given at a lovely &quot;Log Cabin Banquet Hall and Meeting Place&quot; in Holyoke, MA.  One of the graduates of the YES program was honored (as was the YES program) for having accomplished starting his own business, being gainfully employed, buying his own home ( at 23 yrs. old) and making good use of the training he received here.  What a nice event, and a most wonderful lunch.  Danielle, I made up for every free meal I&#39;ve ever missed in Boston in the last 6 months!!!  The event was a 15 year annual meeting given by the Trustees of the Community Foundation of Western MA, an organization that funded our odd jobs program, and one of the many programs that Leon Howard ( our own celebrity guest of honor) was able to avail himself of while a youth in town. </p>

	    <p>On the Monday following VISTA Pre-service Orientation,  I went to YES, Inc., the organization that had sponsored my opportunity to join Americorps.</p>
<p>Pat, the VISTA who has served them during this past year had already opened up and gotten the place warm functioning.  Amoung the features of YES, Inc. is a business center with copiers, printers and a cyber cafe, which is basically a room lined with <br />computers that the community can come in and use.</p>
<p>Pat and I took an inventory of the computers and identified a number of problems with various machines in the cyber cafe.</p>
<p>Tim, the director, and I talked about the websites I was recruited to assist with and I was shown a list of bugs, feature enhancements and wishes for the website.</p>
<p>As he talked about the various volunteers who were already assisting the program, what they had accomplished and how much more there was to do, I began to understand why it&#39;s important for a VISTA to be full time.  If the other projects are anything<br />like this one, they could probably use even more help than just one VISTA could provide.</p>
<p>Still, the PSO was a wonderful investment and I would even suggest that CTC-Vista program hold occasional &quot;open houses&quot; so that prospective volunteers could<br />really get to know the program prior to the weekend in which they swear in.</p>
<p>Anyway, during this first week, I discovered the need for a helpdesk/bug/feature tracking system so that we can collect the IT needs of this on-going operation in a standardized, web-enabled way that will allow both staff and clients to contribute their observations<br />into an organized task oriented system.  I also discovered that there is a big need to separate the email accounts from the website space so that volunteers can work on the site without full access to the more sensitive project information.  I contacted Dreamhost and Gaia Hosting as prospective hosting solutions.  I suggested Exohelpdesk as the bug/feature/helpdesk application platform here at YES Inc and started the installation process.  Next week I plan to work with staff to train them how to use it.</p>
<p>end of week 1.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted,</p>
<p>Steve Wills, </p>
<p>YES, Inc. Volunteer.</p>

				<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>Does anyone work with adult computer literacy programs? I was hoping to peek at how others covered the topic of saving files.  Our students seem to not get &#39;save as&#39; and &#39;send to.&#39;  I&#39;d love to see how other programs approach this topic, so we can adapt our curriculum.  I love best practices :).</p>
<p>If you know of a program, somebody who runs a program or have a link to a program, then I would be very appreciative. Thanks!</p>

				<p>Erin Taylor asked me to write a little something for the upcoming VISTA digest... here is what I submitted (a sneak preview!):</p>
<p>You would think creating a  new media literacy series would be easy enough. There are enough of  them out there. Thus, when I was asked as a brand new VISTA to create  a new media literacy curriculum for Project: Think Different, I figured  I would just quote some Noam Chomsky and maybe throw in some media statistics  and get something at least presentable together. The task seemed simple.  </p>
<p>But, (there is always a “but”)  I needed to make the curriculum accessible to teens. Boston teens. Boston  teens living in the neighborhoods in which teenage death rates are the  highest, in which an attraction to hip-hop music and commercial materialism  are identifying aspects of the youth culture, and in which young people  are most likely to be portrayed in the news media in relation to situations  of crime and violence. Clearly these are the teens in the greatest need  of media literacy awareness, but how in the world was a white, relatively  affluent, punk, college-graduate female from Austin, Texas ever going  to create something that actually works for these kids? Seeing as my  first days in Boston included getting severely confused by public transportation,  being shocked at how many people lacked innate kindness, and staring  in disbelief at how the seemingly numerous Dunkin’ Donuts actually  all had customers, the task seemed slightly daunting at best. How could  I ever relate? </p>
<p>A lot has changed since that  first week. I live amongst the people I work with. I listen to the music  they listen to. I shop at the places they shop. I see the things they  see. I travel the way they travel. I even use food stamps. It is amazing  how much you can learn by immersion. Immersing yourself in the culture  is what every foreign language instructor will advise when one is trying  to acquire a second language. My project was no different.   </p>
<p>Now that I have immersed myself  in the community in which I work, being the Youth Media Coordinator  for Project: Think Different has gone extremely well. Project: Think  Different’s mission is to create a renaissance in music, film and  video media education in order to engage people in civic dialogue and  action among disenfranchised communities to ensure equity and fairness.  We use the media arts as an organizing tool to reach disenfranchised  young people and enable them to “think differently” and think big  about their ability to create positive change in their lives, communities,  and society at large.  </p>
<p>After a whole lot of work with  our Media Watch Team (a group of ten teens that work part time at Project:  Think Different and came up with the outlines for the workshops in the  curriculum), fairly high stress levels, and maybe a small skirmish or  two with my co-developer Cara Powers, the Media Action Series<strong> </strong> is complete. It is an interactive multi-session training, co-facilitated  by the youth of the Media Watch Team. The new curriculum addresses the  media’s role in creating a culture of violence, racism, sexism, and  commercialism while educating, empowering and organizing youth to take  action on the subjects of media literacy, accountability, access and  policy. The Series will look at the various forms of media with a focus  on entertainment media, popular culture, and Hip Hop media specifically,  that youth consume as entertainment and informants of their socio-political  perspectives and social behaviors. </p>
<p>Our<strong> </strong> objective through the Media Action Series is to create a culture in  which young people believe in their power to create change in the media  and beyond, and to provide youth the education and access to resources  to become well informed, socially responsible, and participatory citizens  of society.  </p>
<p>The Media Action Series launches the  first week of November, 2006. We hope to examine  how the media’s portrayal of youth and minority communities affects  their own senses of worth and value to society, how our behavior, language,  and attitude is affected by the media industry, and likewise, how other  people’s perceptions of our behavior are affected by the media’s  perpetuation and proliferation of stereotypes. We  also hope to address the  negative aspects of today’s commercial Hip Hop and popular culture  with solution-oriented approaches, inspiring young people to become  more conscious consumers of music, video, television, radio, and news  media, enabling them to recognize the alternatives available that offer  more empowering and positive experiences; thus cultivating a culture  of young people who believe in their own ability to demand and create  those alternatives. </p>
<p>By keeping the curriculum centered  on a hip hop culture, I feel the Media Action Series has a unique potential  to engage Boston’s youth and inspire them to take part in positive  social change. All in all, I am happy with the finished product. By  learning my second language, the language of a Boston teen, I have become  part of something so much bigger than myself. I can only hope some of  Boston’s youth can learn a fraction of everything that I have.</p>

	    <p>Colleen, I&#39;ve been meaning post how incredibly thoughtful and intriguing I found your Digest article, too.  I&#39;ve sent a version of my thoughts as a comment to the Digest – let me echo gariet and Bill&#39;s interests, too, and request to see the curriculum, but let me suggests, too, that this be put on the Digest site, too, at the very least, a link on how to get it. In addition to being interested in see the curriculum, I want to let you know how impressed I was by the vivid sense you convey about life on the streets and your quick introduction to and immersion in it, your description of Project Think Different&#39;s Mission and the initial project development, and the photo of the Media Watch Team.   Because it&#39;s so promising, do let me offer a couple of suggestions for your consideration. In contrast to the beginning of your piece, your description of the Media Action Series is outlined in somewhat rhetorical/ideological language. Some more immediate description along with a link to the series itself or at least how to request it -- surely this is the rousing conclusion one would hope to find to your work and that of the Media Watch Team and PTD.     This appears to be exactly the kind of model project that the CTC VISTA Project strives to support and to share as widely as possible and I hope you all can make the most of it for yourselves, too.  I look forward to learning more about this highly informative effort.  best, ----peter miller</p>

<p>So, Peter - first off - thank you so much for your kind words concerning my Digest article. I appreciate it! Also, I am grateful for the more personal comment on my writing.</p>
<p> As for linking to the curriculum in the article, I can&#39;t really re-write the article, but I can put a link for you here -</p>

	    <p>Do you know what program the .ayw files were created in?  I&#39;m not familiar with that file type, so at this point, my best guess is there might be some sort of way to reopen them in the program that created them, and save with a different extension.   If you can give me some more information about the files though, I might be able to be more helpful. </p>
<p>If all else fails, you will probably have to set up a camera to record your monitor (via firewire, not by actually shooting it), play the files, and then dump them back onto your computer from the miniDV tape, and convert them to quicktimes from there.</p>

	    <p>I should have been a bit more clear on this.  An .ayw extension is the extension that Animate your World creates when you save animations created in the software. I tried the save as feature with no such luck.   I would love to set up a camera to record but I do not have access to one.</p>

				<p>I am blogging about my frustration over Andrea (or Andie as she loves to be called) not finishing her roll of film from Boston. She has all of these awesome pictures of Goof Troop goofiness and they&#39;re suspended in a disposable Kodak :(. They should definitely be on Flickr. So Andie, please finish the roll - take some pictures of Matt! So far he&#39;s like your snuffalufugus (sp?). I mean, how do we <em>really</em> know he exists? This is the scientific age, we need proof. Anyone who feels the same, comment so she feels extra guilty :) Love you Andie!</p>

				<p>Does anyoneknow how one goes about doing a background check?</p>
<p>We had a guy come in to volunteer a while ago, and he seemed okay. but until that point we hadn&#39;t had anyone come with us that the MoLLIE supervisor didn&#39;t know. Everyone had already worked with MoLLIE before. And for some reason, Jeanne and I thought the same thing at the same time after he left, &#39;what do we really now about this guy?&#39;</p>
<p>It was surprising to me that in 5 years, the idea of doing background checks on people had not occured to those running a program that works regularly with children. That&#39;s like a no brainer, right? There&#39;s laws about this sort of thing, right? Well, from now on we are going to do checks on employees and volunteers, we just have to figure out how. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, no one here knows anything about how to do background checks. I did some looking online a few weeks ago. You get dozens of sites claiming to do background checks. On several of them I checked myself. And though I didn&#39;t give my social security number, the sites could have still done better. most of the info was wrong, stating that I had lived in several cities that I have not, etc.</p>
<p>Jeanne is gone for most of the week helping her father in Florida. She asked me to try to figure the background check issue while she was gone. I&#39;m not sure where to look. the proliferation of such sites online make it hard to determine which, if any, are on the level. So if anyone has suggestions, I&#39;d love to hear from you. </p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

	    <p>Generally people have to go to a &quot;background check company&quot; and get fingerprinted. The fingerprinting aspect is crucial to find out if the person has any recorded criminal offenses, especially if it involves children. Simply looking someone up online does not tell you much. Check with local organizations, especially those that work with youth (maybe the YMCA?), and see who they use to do background checks. Either let them know who you are or pretend to be a volunteer and find out where you would have to go to get a background check. Hope this helps a little!</p>

	    <p>I ran into the same sort of questions as we are helping with a mentoring program here. The volunteers are doing some work with the YMCA who requires them to be fingerprinted (they call it &quot;livescan&quot;) and also receive a TB test. I guess for the fingerprinting you would need to find a local place in your area, the Y here does it on their own I believe. I did some research for the TB tests and found out that the county does offer free and/or low costs TB screenings, so your city might as well. As far as a real &quot;background&quot; check, such as criminal history and what-not, I believe that the state or city website has a lot of that information or else they give information to websites like SafetyNet and Meagan&#39;s Law. Hope that helps at least a little!</p>

	    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p> I&#39;m actually in the process of going through the whole background check process for the YMCA (for the same program that Corey mentioned in her comment).  I haven&#39;t actually physically gone in yet, so I can&#39;t tell you exactly how it&#39;s done, but my next step is to go in for  &quot;Live Scan Service,&quot; which will include fingerprinting.  The Y here uses Identix Identification Services to conduct their background checks.  You may want to check out their website to see what sort of information they have there, although I can&#39;t make any promises as to how useful it may be as I haven&#39;t visited it myself.  Their website is <a href="http://www.identix.com/">www.identix.com</a>.  Good luck and hope it helps!</p>

	    <p>I just went throught the same process.  Go to the DCFS website for the state you are working in and they will tell you what you need, as well as give suggestions of places you can try.  I&#39;ve also found other organizations that work with children in your area, with whom your NPO might be friendly with generally give good advice.</p>

				<p>While I can&#39;t think of anything particularly noteworthy at the moment, I&#39;ve got a post-it not tacked to my monitor, glaring at me menacingly with the following words, &quot;Submit a $%@# blog entry already&quot;.  I can take a hint.  Well, sometimes anyway.  </p>
<p> I guess the big news now is that we&#39;re a week from our fall graduation.  For me, that means getting the last of my interviews filmed and then whipping up a video.  Good thing I&#39;ve only got half the interviews, time is running short, and I&#39;ve never done this sort of thing before.  For a moment I was almost worried there.  Luckily (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it), we&#39;re graduating 12-13 kids in what will be a relatively small ceremony.  While that cuts into the amount of footage that I need to sift through, it reflects our shrunken attendance which is proving to cause a problem with a good amount of it affecting my position.</p>
<p> Due to the decrease in attendance, my workshops have seen a corresponding drop in attendance once school began.  I&#39;d be hard pressed to get more than 2-3 kids in most of the workshops, and the reason we get 2-3 instead of 1 is because the lab staff coerced walk-in kids to attend.  Its not like we&#39;re doing 3-hour classes on Excel.  It&#39;s more &#39;cool&#39; stuff like Photoshop composites, remixing in GarageBand, making short films in iMovie, etc.  However I think many of our kids would rather sit there and do nothing instead of actually having to expend some effort and thought in a workshop.  In fact, when the lab staff gives our kids 3 options: 1) Go to the Workshop, 2) Do homework for the duration of the workshop, or 3) go home, most would choose to go home.  </p>
<p> As much as I enjoy working for C4K, the lack of motivation in many of our kids is getting to be pretty frustrating.  I know we just need to get a few of them started doing cool stuff and then others will want to do it, but just getting them started is proving to be well beyond my capacities.  In the meantime, we&#39;re looking at focusing more on shorter in-lab activities to address the commitment, competence, and 10-second attention span of our students, so hopefully we can get something going that way.</p>
<p> Anyway, its been neat checking out what all the new VISTAs are up to and I&#39;m looking forward to seeing how all of your service years progress.</p>

	    <p>Maybe you could introduce kids to some of the media that other kids have made? You could show some short films some afternoons or even just leave them playing on a tv/computer screen (heck, watch them yourself and kids will look over your shoulder). Introduce kids to YouTube, even: within a week of finding out about YouTube, my roommate was making and posting videos (he&#39;s not a kid, but close). I guess what kids are interested in doing--videotaping pranks and skateboarding mishaps, making obnoxious sound effects, etc--pushes the boundaries of what adults like to see, but it gets them involved... At the September PSO we saw some films from the <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/">media that matters film festival</a>, which has a bunch of films made by 13-21 year olds (the films are all on their website, plus they&#39;ll send a dvd if you want to host a screening).</p>

	    <p> I have noticed that kids are very competitive.  If you have a couple of kids who are really showing interest in a particular thing and they develop a project based on that interest, other ones may think, &quot;I can do that&quot; or &quot;I can do that better.&quot;   See if you can grab their attention by showing what others have produced.  I hope all goes well for you and your group.</p>

				<p>Hey guys so for those of you interested in the differences between the different CMSs, NTEN has a &#39;webinar&#39; (i&#39;m assuming a seminar on the web) on Nov. 15th entitled </p>
<h1>&quot;NTEN and Idealware Software Review Series: Comparing Open Source CMS&#39;s&quot;</h1>
<p>More info <a href="https://www.ntenonline.org/eweb/Dynamicpage.aspx?webcode=EventInfo&amp;evt_key=061cce1d-2e2e-478b-b0bf-7307e3ab9d8a" target="_blank" class="links">here</a>. </p>
<p>Of course the real catch here is that like most seminars...this one costs money, which we are all in short supply of. Maybe you could convince your supervisors that its a professional development expense and they&#39;ll pay for it.</p>
<p>Just saw it and thought someone would be interested. </p>

<p>Ah, I got a bit of a break, but the conference fall season has begun.  I presented at the <a href="http://www.macdc.org/docs/convention.html" target="_blank">Massachusetts Association of Community Development Corporations (MACDC) Convention</a> on how to use digital storytelling as a community organizing tool.  Here&#39;s the <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/~danielle/digstory/digstory_madc_ppt.pdf" target="_blank" title="MACDC PowerPoint Presentation PDF">Powerpoint</a>, the <a href="http://digitalartscorps.org/files/digstory_handout_macdc2.pdf" target="_blank">handout</a> and <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/blog/danielle_martin/archives/cat_digital_storytelling.html" target="_blank">worksheet</a>.</p>
<p>The session went well (I love how easy it is to present using my new MacBook) and people asked all the right questions about usability &amp; practicality of using digital storytelling in a community setting.  They also seemed psyched about all the new open media tools and sites and how to use stories to do advocacy for their CDC&#39;s.  I also had some great interactions with some folks from New Bedford and western MA including a former VISTA who are lacking media outlets and access to broadband internet connections, but still want to distribute audio/video about their community work.  Hey Apple, want to donate some video iPods to western MA CDCs to distribute digital stories?  Call me!</p>
<p>Below are a few photos of the event. </p>

	    <p>Hey thanks for that pdf with the list of resources and so on.  I&#39;ve been talking to a local writing group that&#39;s a couple of streets of way.  We want to do a joint project with the area youth where they (<a href="http://www.inktank.org" target="_blank" title="inktank">Inktank</a>) will work on the writing and story development side and they we (media bridges) will work on the digital media side.  This will help us get going.</p>
