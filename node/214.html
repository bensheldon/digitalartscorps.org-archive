				<p>Erin Taylor asked me to write a little something for the upcoming VISTA digest... here is what I submitted (a sneak preview!):</p>
<p>You would think creating a  new media literacy series would be easy enough. There are enough of  them out there. Thus, when I was asked as a brand new VISTA to create  a new media literacy curriculum for Project: Think Different, I figured  I would just quote some Noam Chomsky and maybe throw in some media statistics  and get something at least presentable together. The task seemed simple.  </p>
<p>But, (there is always a “but”)  I needed to make the curriculum accessible to teens. Boston teens. Boston  teens living in the neighborhoods in which teenage death rates are the  highest, in which an attraction to hip-hop music and commercial materialism  are identifying aspects of the youth culture, and in which young people  are most likely to be portrayed in the news media in relation to situations  of crime and violence. Clearly these are the teens in the greatest need  of media literacy awareness, but how in the world was a white, relatively  affluent, punk, college-graduate female from Austin, Texas ever going  to create something that actually works for these kids? Seeing as my  first days in Boston included getting severely confused by public transportation,  being shocked at how many people lacked innate kindness, and staring  in disbelief at how the seemingly numerous Dunkin’ Donuts actually  all had customers, the task seemed slightly daunting at best. How could  I ever relate? </p>
<p>A lot has changed since that  first week. I live amongst the people I work with. I listen to the music  they listen to. I shop at the places they shop. I see the things they  see. I travel the way they travel. I even use food stamps. It is amazing  how much you can learn by immersion. Immersing yourself in the culture  is what every foreign language instructor will advise when one is trying  to acquire a second language. My project was no different.   </p>
<p>Now that I have immersed myself  in the community in which I work, being the Youth Media Coordinator  for Project: Think Different has gone extremely well. Project: Think  Different’s mission is to create a renaissance in music, film and  video media education in order to engage people in civic dialogue and  action among disenfranchised communities to ensure equity and fairness.  We use the media arts as an organizing tool to reach disenfranchised  young people and enable them to “think differently” and think big  about their ability to create positive change in their lives, communities,  and society at large.  </p>
<p>After a whole lot of work with  our Media Watch Team (a group of ten teens that work part time at Project:  Think Different and came up with the outlines for the workshops in the  curriculum), fairly high stress levels, and maybe a small skirmish or  two with my co-developer Cara Powers, the Media Action Series<strong> </strong> is complete. It is an interactive multi-session training, co-facilitated  by the youth of the Media Watch Team. The new curriculum addresses the  media’s role in creating a culture of violence, racism, sexism, and  commercialism while educating, empowering and organizing youth to take  action on the subjects of media literacy, accountability, access and  policy. The Series will look at the various forms of media with a focus  on entertainment media, popular culture, and Hip Hop media specifically,  that youth consume as entertainment and informants of their socio-political  perspectives and social behaviors. </p>
<p>Our<strong> </strong> objective through the Media Action Series is to create a culture in  which young people believe in their power to create change in the media  and beyond, and to provide youth the education and access to resources  to become well informed, socially responsible, and participatory citizens  of society.  </p>
<p>The Media Action Series launches the  first week of November, 2006. We hope to examine  how the media’s portrayal of youth and minority communities affects  their own senses of worth and value to society, how our behavior, language,  and attitude is affected by the media industry, and likewise, how other  people’s perceptions of our behavior are affected by the media’s  perpetuation and proliferation of stereotypes. We  also hope to address the  negative aspects of today’s commercial Hip Hop and popular culture  with solution-oriented approaches, inspiring young people to become  more conscious consumers of music, video, television, radio, and news  media, enabling them to recognize the alternatives available that offer  more empowering and positive experiences; thus cultivating a culture  of young people who believe in their own ability to demand and create  those alternatives. </p>
<p>By keeping the curriculum centered  on a hip hop culture, I feel the Media Action Series has a unique potential  to engage Boston’s youth and inspire them to take part in positive  social change. All in all, I am happy with the finished product. By  learning my second language, the language of a Boston teen, I have become  part of something so much bigger than myself. I can only hope some of  Boston’s youth can learn a fraction of everything that I have.</p>

	    <p>Colleen, I&#39;ve been meaning post how incredibly thoughtful and intriguing I found your Digest article, too.  I&#39;ve sent a version of my thoughts as a comment to the Digest – let me echo gariet and Bill&#39;s interests, too, and request to see the curriculum, but let me suggests, too, that this be put on the Digest site, too, at the very least, a link on how to get it. In addition to being interested in see the curriculum, I want to let you know how impressed I was by the vivid sense you convey about life on the streets and your quick introduction to and immersion in it, your description of Project Think Different&#39;s Mission and the initial project development, and the photo of the Media Watch Team.   Because it&#39;s so promising, do let me offer a couple of suggestions for your consideration. In contrast to the beginning of your piece, your description of the Media Action Series is outlined in somewhat rhetorical/ideological language. Some more immediate description along with a link to the series itself or at least how to request it -- surely this is the rousing conclusion one would hope to find to your work and that of the Media Watch Team and PTD.     This appears to be exactly the kind of model project that the CTC VISTA Project strives to support and to share as widely as possible and I hope you all can make the most of it for yourselves, too.  I look forward to learning more about this highly informative effort.  best, ----peter miller</p>
