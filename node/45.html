				<p><img src="http://digitalartscorps.org/files/user4/1pic2.jpg" alt="youth on computers" title="youth on computers" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="134" height="91" align="right" />Through Networks for Youth Development   the <a href="http://www.fcny.org/portal.php/syd/">Fund     for the City of New York</a> developed a handbook   of &quot;positive youth outcomes&quot; for practitioners. Youth   development programs help youth develop competencies   that will enable them to grow, develop skills, and   become healthy, responsible, and caring people. Youth   development is a shared responsibility, practioners   cannot do it alone. They need the buy-in of youth,   their families and community partners because many   factors affect young people&#39;s lives. Networks for Youth   Development has combined research, discussion, and   practical experience in articulating best practices   of youth development. They have identified the following   competencies for positive youth outcomes:
</p><p><strong>O</strong>riginality (Creative Competency)</p>
<p><strong>U</strong>nderstanding ourselves and others (Personal competency)</p>
<p><strong>T</strong>hinking and reasoning (Cognitive competency)</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>ivic competency</p>
<p><strong>O</strong>ur bodies   (Physical health competency)</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>ental health competency</p>
<p><strong>E</strong>mployability competency</p>
<p><strong>S</strong>ocial competency</p>
<p>All young people will not demonstrate   these competencies in the same way. These are progressive   competencies that young people will develop at different   rates. Obviously, young people can obtain these competencies   in many ways but for the purposes of this site we will   focus on the use of digital media to achieve various   outcomes. </p>
<p><strong>Positive Youth Outcomes with   Digital Media </strong></p>
<p>Creative competency applies to the exploration   and development of self-expression. Digital media-related   activities provide youth with opportunities for artistic   expression, to express individuality, etc. Achievement   outcomes include developing or publishing portfolios. </p>
<p>Personal   competency applies to actions that reflect the understanding   of one&#39;s own opinions and thoughts and those of others   in order to handle situations appropriately and non-violently.   For many people the Internet and World Wide Web has   opened up whole new worlds. Young people are using   chat rooms, discussion forums, weblogs, and   web sites to connect to articulate and listen to others,   recognize and relate to themselves and others, and   define and analyze issues. Achievement outcomes include   securing adequate living arrangements, having safe   environments, managing money, and daily living routines. </p>
<p>Cognitive competency applies to intellectual   development and the integration of information into   operational functions. This is where educational activities   play an important role. Tutorial programs help young   people become more aware of their learning process   and develop analytical and organizational thinking.   They are able to set goals and develop basic skills.   Achievement outcomes include getting a high school   diploma or GED, or mastery of English language. Regarding   digital media, this area is wide open for exploration. </p>
<p>Civic competency applies to a core of   respect and value for civil and human rights of oneself   and others and the recognition that one can further   these rights for oneself and one&#39;s community by participating   in the governmental process and in community service   and  organization. Digital media can be a tool for   developing this competency in a variety of ways. Achievement   outcomes include creating Public Service Announcements   and slide shows, publishing web sites and brochures.</p>
<p>Physical health competency applies to   the ability to maintain one&#39;s well-being and to identify,   understand, and practice healthy behaviors. Achievement   outcomes include creating PSAs and  web sites   with information regarding regular   physical examinations health maintenance. </p>
<p>Mental health competency applies to the   ability to identify, understand and deal with one&#39;s   emotions and feelings.</p>
<p>Employability competency applies to vocational   awareness based upon analysis of the current labor   market and work-place conditions; they are not perscriptive   judgments. The loss of U.S. jobs to overseas competitors   is shaping up to be one of the defining issues of the   new century. People are seeing   not just a decline in manufacturing jobs, but also   the outsourcing of hundreds of thousands of digital   media-related jobs--everything from software coders   to video editors. </p>
<p>&quot;Other countries are   now encroaching more directly and successfully on what   has been, for almost two decades, the heartland of   our economic success -- the creative economy. Better   than any other country in recent years, America has   developed new technologies and ideas that spawn new   industries and modernize old ones, from the Internet   to big-box stores to innovative product designs. And   these have proved the principal force behind the U.S.   economy&#39;s creation of more than 20 million jobs in   the creative sector during the 1990s, even as it continued   to shed manufacturing, agricultural, and other jobs.&quot;   - From <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0401.florida.html">Creative Class War by Richard Florida</a> </p>
<p>Achievement outcomes for employability   include  jobs and mentoring for youth through workforce   development (partnerships), job certification and training,   GED and high school diploma, and job retention.</p>
<p>Social competency applies to the manner   in which one consistently responds to other individuals,   expects other individuals to respond to oneself and   interaction with members of groups sharing one&#39;s &quot;social   address&quot; as well as with members of groups different   than one&#39;s own. Achievement outcomes include the ability   to form and maintain consistent relationships, i.e.   through conferences, youth festivals, and screenings. </p>
<p><strong>Myth of the   Digital Generation</strong></p>
<p> This refers to the idea   that growing up online is going to produce a more socially   connected, better informed, and more creative generation.   In a way, having access to online, digital media content   can increase awareness and knowledge of the world.   In another way, this myth can distort the reality kids   must negotiate in the online world, and exaggerate   the centrality of digital media in children&#39;s lives.</p>
<p>Studies show that young people are using   the Internet effectively as a resource for doing homework,   connecting with friends, and seeking out news and entertainment.   This does not mean they are more media literate or   more able to succeed in school. Young people should   have a menu of educational activities both online and   offline. Media education should be a part of their   education, in order to be better informed about digital   media.</p>
