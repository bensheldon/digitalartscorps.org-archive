				<p>Here are the actual quotes from this guy all I did was copy and paste notice how it is in all caps i recieved it as I he was shouting and trying to prove a point like a teenage "GURL"</p>
<p>Since I am creating timelines I have enough literature for a whole book if I keep at it so pretty soon you all will be reading my book. (lol) For real thats the new plan I have to get something out of this experience and I want this information to be public.</p>
<p>"THANKS FOR THE APOLOGY, THOUGH I REALIZE THAT THE PHONE AND INTERNET ARE A CHALLENGE AT THE MOMENT.  WHEN THE EMAIL IS STRAIGHTENED OUT THAT MAY BE THE BEST WAY TO COMMUNICATE SINCE WE SEE EACH OTHER SO LITTLE. "</p>
<p>" I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU LOOK AT ME AS SOMEONE WHO IS "TRIPPING" AND WATCHING YOUR EVERY MOVE.  I'LL JUST SAY THAT I HAVE NO TIME TO WATCH THE EVERY MOVE OF YOU OR ANY OF OUR PAST VISTA'S.  MY CONCERN WAS THAT I HAD INVITED YOU TO BREAKFAST FRIDAY AND I THOUGHT YOU'D ACCEPTED, BUT I DID NOT GET A REPLY TO MY EMAILS OF MONDAY OR THURSDAY AFTERNOON.  NOR COULD I CALL YOU, THOUGH I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAD TO LIMIT INCOMING CALLS FOR FINANCIAL REASONS."  </p>
<p>"I WAS SOMEWHAT SLIGHTED THAT YOU SKIPPED OUR BREAKFAST WITHOUT COMMUNICATING WITH ME, BUT I BECAME TRULY CONCERNED WHEN I WAS UNABLE TO FIND YOU AT COLLINS CENTER AND WAS INFORMED THAT YOU HAD NOT BEEN IN ALL WEEK (AND HAD NOT CALLED OR EMAILED EITHER).  I LATER LEARNED FROM DIEGO THAT YOU WERE NOT AT YE-TEC EITHER THAT FRIDAY, A WORKDAY. </p>
<p>PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT VISTA IS NOT A WORK STUDY PROGRAM BUT A FULL-TIME SERVICE COMMITMENT, AND YOUR CONTINUED RECEIPT OF FEDERAL BENEFITS -- LITTLE AS THEY ARE -- IS DEPENDENT ON MEETING THE TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT WITH CTC VISTA.  COLLINS CENTER IS OBLIGATED TO ENSURE THAT VISTA'S SERVE A FULL-TIME SCHEDULE, AND I HAD AGREED TO BE YOUR INTERIM SUPERVISOR WHILE DONNA WAS AWAY. </p>
<p>FOR YOUR INFORMATION, I RESPONDED EXACTLY THE SAME WAY WITH VICTORIA ONE DAY LAST FALL WHEN SHE COULD NOT BE FOUND AT COLLINS CENTER OR REACHED BY PHONE OR EMAIL.  IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE HAD GONE ON AN OUT-OF-STATE VACATION BUT HAD FORGOTTEN TO REMIND DONNA OR ME (WE HAD APPROVED A VACATION A MONTH EARLIER), AND SHE HAD NOT PUT THE VACATION ON THE COLLINS CENTER CALENDAR.  SHOWING UP TO WORK EACH DAY, STAYING THROUGH THE FULL WORK DAY, AND REPORTING ANY VARIATIONS IN THE SCHEDULE TO YOUR SUPERVISOR (AND TO EVELYN AT COLLINS CENTER) ARE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROJECT AND ARE NOT SOMETHING SINGLED OUT FOR ANY ONE PERSON."</p>
<p>"I'M VERY SORRY THAT YOU AND VICTORIA HAVE GOTTEN OFF TO A DIFFICULT START.  I WILL COMMUNICATE YOUR REQUEST TO VICTORIA IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T DONE SO DIRECTLY, BUT IF YOU TWO CAN'T WORK IT OUT I PREFER TO LEAVE THE RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER TO YOUR SUPERVISOR.  DONNA HAS BEEN VICTORIA'S CO-SUPERVISOR AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THE ISSUES BETWEEN YOU AND VICTORIA.  IF I AM NEEDED FOR ANY REASON, DONNA WILL LET ME KNOW.  TO THE EXTENT THAT EITHER OF YOU EXERCISED UNPROFESSIONAL DEMEANOR, WHETHER INTENTIONAL OR INADVERTENT, I WOULD HOPE THAT APOLOGY(IES) WILL ENSUE.  (IN MY EXPERIENCE, A PROCEDURE FOR RESOLVING SITUATIONS LIKE THIS IS FOR THE SUPERVISOR TO HOLD A MEETING WHERE EACH PERSON DISCUSSED THEIR POINT OF VIEW TO THE OTHER, BUT I LEAVE IT TO DONNA TO DECIDE WHETHER TO DO THAT OR NOT.)"</p>
<p>"I AM SORRY YOU THINK THAT IS THE OPINION OF YOUR SUPERVISORS; IT IS NOT.  EXCEPT FOR THE THURSDAY BEFORE LAST I HAVE VIRTUALLY NO DIRECT INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE, OR NOT DONE, SO THAT QUOTE COULD NOT POSSIBLY REFLECT MY OPINION OF A MONTH OF SERVICE.  THE ONLY "DRAMA" ON MY PART WAS LAST FRIDAY WHEN I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR TEMPORARILY SUPERVISING YOU AND DISCOVERED YOU WERE NOT REPORTING TO WORK, AND THAT IS HARDLY "UNNECESSARY" -- IT IS THE ESSENCE OF A SUPERVISOR'S RESPONSIBILITY.  </p>
<p>IN MY VIEW, THE ADJUSTMENT PERIOD FOR A NEW VISTA REQUIRES THAT WE ALLOW TIME FOR YOU TO GET FAMILIAR WITH THE PROJECT AND THEN SET PERSONAL OBJECTIVES THAT ARE REALISTIC FOR YOUR SKILLS, INTERESTS, AND THE PROJECT'S GOALS.  UNTIL THAT POINT -- WHICH APPARENTLY YOU'VE NOW REACHED -- IT IS INEVITABLE THAT THERE WILL BE SOME MOMENTS OF INDECISION AND LACK OF FOCUSED PROGRESS, AS WAS TRUE WITH BOTH PAST VISTA'S.  I THINK THAT THE FIRST MONTH'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE NOT EASILY MEASURABLE; WHAT COUNTS IS WHAT A VISTA DOES OVER THE ENTIRE COURSE OF THEIR YEAR OF SERVICE."<br />
"NO, YOU ARE ONLY SERVING AS THE CO-OP VISTA.  THE OTHER POSITION WAS TO WORK ON POLICY AND RESEARCH ISSUES WITH MYSELF AND A PARTNER ORGANIZATION, UNDER DIRECTION OF THE PARTNER ORGANIZATION, AND YOU HAVE NO DUTIES IN THIS AREA.  TO THE CONTRARY, YOUR WORK IN THE CO-OP SHOULD ACTUALLY BE ENHANCED BY THE FACT THAT VICTORIA WAS RETAINED -- SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT PLANNED AT THE TIME OF RECRUITMENT -- AND IS ABLE TO SPEND SOME PART OF HER TIME ASSISTING WITH THE CO-OP PROJECT.  THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE LESS TO DO; IT MEANS YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH MORE IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT WORKING IN ISOLATION.  IT WILL BE YOUR AND DONNA'S DECISION AS TO WHAT YOUR WORKPLAN WILL BE, AND WHETHER YOU AND VICTORIA WORK JOINTLY OR SIMPLY COORDINATE ACTIVITIES."<br />
"  DONNA CAN DISCUSS THIS WITH YOU BUT CTC VISTA IS A NATIONAL PROGRAM WITH ITS OWN RULES; THEY ARE NOT OUR RULES THOUGH WE ARE OBLIGATED TO FOLLOW THEM.  YOUR POSITION IS FULL-TIME AND PAYS HEALTH, TRAINING, AND A STIPEND FOR COMPLETION IN ADDITION TO THE POVERTY-LEVEL WAGES.  TO MY KNOWLEDGE OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT IS NOT PERMITTED BY CTC VISTA, BUT IN ANY EVENT THE MINIMUM WORK WEEK IS STANDARD FOR ALL VISTA'S NATIONWIDE.  </p>
<p>YOU ARE WELCOME BUT IN NO WAY OBLIGATED TO WORK HOURS BEYOND THE MINIMUM CTC VISTA SERVICE COMMITMENT.  IF YOU HAVE AN EVENING OR WEEKEND WORK EVENT, YOU ARE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR SUPERVISOR AND WITH EVELYN AT THE COLLINS CENTER TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO YOUR NORMAL SCHEDULE.  THERE IS FLEXIBILITY SO LONG AS YOU COMMUNICATE IN A TIMELY WAY, BUT I LEAVE ALL QUESTIONS OF YOUR VISTA SCHEDULE AND WORK TO YOUR SUPERVISOR."<br />
" GOOD QUESTION, SINCE I DON'T SEE WHY THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DRAMA AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU ASSOCIATE ME WITH "ALL OF THIS PRESSURE".  </p>
<p>IT SEEMED TO ME THAT YOU WERE ALREADY FEELING PRESSURE THE FIRST TIME I MET YOU, THE DAY WE WENT TO LUNCH, AND I TRIED TO SUGGEST WAYS TO ALLEVIATE MONEY PRESSURES.  IT WAS HARDLY MY INTENT TO ADD PRESSURE WHEN I POINTED OUT WAYS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO EXAMINE PERSONAL BUDGETS TO FIND WAYS TO ECONOMIZE.  YET DONNA TELLS ME YOU LATER BECAME UPSET WHEN I GAVE YOU THE EXAMPLE OF KEVIN, OUR FIRST VISTA, WHO PUT HIS CAR OUT OF SERVICE IN ORDER TO AVOID INSURANCE PAYMENTS AND REPAIR COSTS DURING HIS YEAR OF SERVICE.  I WANTED TO GIVE YOU TOOLS TO EXAMINE YOUR EXPENSES IN VIEW OF INCOME, AND I THOUGHT THAT BUDGETING WOULD BE A USEFUL SKILL FOR THE GRANTS AS WELL.  MY MOTIVATION WAS NOT TO PRESSURE YOU BUT TO EMPOWER YOU TO SET AND LIVE WITHIN A BUDGET; ANY DECISIONS ABOUT YOUR FINANCES ARE QUITE OBVIOUSLY YOUR OWN.  IF YOU THOUGHT MY SUGGESTIONS WERE ADDING PRESSURE THEN I APOLOGIZE FOR THE MISUNDERSTANDING BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WAS THE FARTHEST THING FROM THE INTENT.  FROM NOW ON I THINK IT BEST THAT I NOT TO ASK ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR GIVE ANY FURTHER ADVICE ABOUT YOUR INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL MATTERS.  </p>
<p>I AM ALSO PUZZLED WHY DONNA, IN HER EMAIL, SEEMED TO THINK I SIDED WITH VICTORIA IN THE DISPUTE THAT I SAW BREWING A WEEK AGO THURSDAY.  IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT VICTORIA'S EFFORT TO COORDINATE CO-OP WORK BY GIVING YOU A DAILY WORK PLAN THAT MORNING WAS COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE AND BEYOND HER ROLE.  AS YOU KNOW I PUT A STOP TO THAT IMMEDIATELY AND I MADE IT CLEAR THAT VICTORIA WAS NOT TO BE YOUR SUPERVISOR, THOUGH I TRIED TO DO SO IN A GENTLE MANNER.  BEFORE YOU STARTED WORKING I HAD ASKED VICTORIA TO HELP GIVE YOU GUIDANCE, JUST AS KEVIN HAD DONE FOR HER LAST YEAR; I THINK SHE WAS TRYING TO INVOLVE YOU IN THE CO-OP WORK IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY, AS SHE AND KEVIN HAD WORKED, BUT SHE DID SO IN A WAY THAT CAUSED PROBLEMS AND RESENTMENT FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.  I SUGGESTED TO YOU THEN, AND TO DONNA BY EMAIL, THAT LONGER-TERM INDIVIDUAL WORKPLANS WOULD BE FAR MORE APPROPRIATE AND I LEFT IT TO DONNA AND YOU TO DECIDE WHAT WAS APPROPRIATE.  I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THAT YOU DID DEVELOP A WORKPLAN AND I WILL LEAVE IT TO YOU AND DONNA TO ASSESS YOUR PROGRESS ON THAT PLAN.  </p>
<p>UNFORTUNATELY YOU AND VICTORIA SEEMED TO UPSET EACH OTHER FURTHER THE NEXT DAY, AND SOMEHOW IT SEEMED YOU LOOKED AT ME AS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DISPUTE IN SOME WAY.  AT THE SATURDAY TRAINING EVENT, I TRIED TO OPEN CONVERSATION WITH YOU DURING THE BREAK BUT IT SEEMED CLEAR THAT YOU HAD NO INTENTION OF SPEAKING WITH ME.  THOUGH YOU SAID NOTHING, I AFTERWARDS GUESSED THAT YOU MUST HAVE BEEN HOLDING ME RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISPUTE IN SOME WAY.  I AM SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY, BUT SINCE DONNA IS YOUR SUPERVISOR AND SINCE YOU AND I DON'T SEEM TO BE UNDERSTANDING OUR COMMUNICATIONS IN THE SAME WAY, I THINK IT BEST TO LEAVE THE RESOLUTION OF THOSE ISSUES TO DONNA UNLESS SHE ASKS ME TO BECOME INVOLVED.  </p>
<p>ALL IN ALL, I AM SORRY THAT YOU HAVE HAD DIFFICULTIES IN YOUR VISTA EXPERIENCE AND I HOPE THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO WORK THEM THROUGH WITH DONNA'S GUIDANCE.  MY HOPE IS THAT IT WILL SIMPLIFY YOUR WORK ENVIRONMENT, AND REDUCE YOUR MIS-PERCEPTIONS OF PRESSURE FROM ME, BY MY LEAVING ALL ISSUES OF WORK SCHEDULE AND WORK PROGRESS TO YOUR SUPERVISOR, EVEN DURING THIS PERIOD WHEN DONNA IS AWAY.  DONNA WILL BE FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO BE PRODUCTIVE AND SATISFIED WITH YOUR VISTA EXPERIENCE, AND THAT YOU SATISFY THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS OF CTC VISTA AND THE COLLINS CENTER."</p>
