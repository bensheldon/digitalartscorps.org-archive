				<p>I put together an Address Book card with everybody&#39;s name, company, and e-mail address, (from the VISTA Roster that we all got). I thought that I could distribute this, and it would make it a lot easier for everybody to contact each other.
</p><p>What I would like to do now is come up with a good way for everybody to:</p>
<p>a) update and distribute the vCard files (when changes are made to their info), and</p>
<p>b) distribute thumbnail headshots of everybody (to attach to their info cards), for that those of us who are terrible at remembering names. </p>
<p>Maybe this is something that nobody else is interested in, but I would very much like to have up-to-date contact cards, and little pictures, of all of the CTC VISTAs. So if any of y&#39;alls have suggestions, or better ideas, let me know. </p>

	    <p>maybe you could include screennames too?</p>
<p>i am not sure if we can include files on blog entries, but if we could and we could make posts that were visible only to logged in people then you could just put it up here. big ifs though.</p>
<p>so maybe... well, we could set up a livejournal or similar account that everyone would have the username and password for and put the contact info there in a locked entry. again files can&#39;t be stored there, but maybe we could just have an old fashioned list instead? although pictures would be nice. we could store the pictures elsewhere and not name them meaningfully and just link to them from the entry. </p>
<p>it seems like most of our contact info won&#39;t be changing too much (at least over the year) so we could just have one person in charge of the contact info and anyone who wanted to change stuff could contact that person. but if we went with the livejournal-type-thing idea anyone could just log in and change their own info. </p>

	    <p>Just an idea to throw out there --  </p>
<p>I know there is a spreadsheet feature on gmail that looks almost like excel and can be shared.   That could take care of sharing our info in one online sheet and also can be set to editable by any of us.   Also, gmail has a chat feature where you can upload a picture and use that as an icon.  The chatting feature can also maybe lead to an online meeting place?   And one more thing about gmail (sorry, I really like gmail), there is a calendar feature that we can add events and birthdays and anything else.   </p>
<p>This option though would require anyone without a gmail account, to add yet another email account to the ever-growing email addresses we all have.  I&#39;ve got 100 invites if anyone is interested in a gmail account, regardless.</p>

The chatting feature can also maybe lead to an online meeting place?   And one more thing about gmail (sorry, I really like gmail), there is a calendar feature that we can add events and birthdays and anything else.   </p>
<p>This option though would require anyone without a gmail account, to add yet another email account to the ever-growing email addresses we all have.  I&#39;ve got 100 invites if anyone is interested in a gmail account, regardless.</p>
