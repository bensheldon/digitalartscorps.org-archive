			 	<a href="1335.html" title="Freezing in August" rel="bookmark"><h1>Freezing in August</h1></a>
			 				 	
			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p>My first month out here in San Francisco at Aspiration has been cold.  I'm used to humid, high 80s in August and I come here and get 50s?  Craziness.  Other than realizing I didn't pack enough long sleeves, my concerns have focused on getting familiar with the programs that I need to use on an everyday basis for Aspiration.  As the Community Manager for our website, Social Source Commons, one of the things that both my boss Gunner (real name, Allen Gunn) and I want to do is really step up the community aspect of the website.  Right now it's a place to find software tools for nonprofits but it lacks a real person to person interactivity that we really want to include into the overall feel of the site.  On top of figuring out how to fernaggle more people into the site, I've also been put in charge of revitalizing the blog.  In the near future it will turn toward more bug-finding, member-interviewing, and behind the scenes web work.  But for now I'm content working in the broader “idea” level.  </p>
<p>Finding a place to live in this city (on an Americoprs stipend no less) is on the same level of lottery-winning.  It's ridiculous.  Luckily I found a cheap place in a good neighborhood that I could afford with the stipend.  Sure, the apartment itself is super sketchy and my roomies may or may not be mentally stable BUT who needs to stay home when they live in a city like San Francisco?  Other than providing a warm couch to sleep on while I endlessly searched for housing, my supervisor Gunner has been really awesome.  He's helped me out with everything that I could have asked for and always makes sure I have what I need.  Because Aspiration is relatively small, Gunner, Mike (the operations manager) and I have become pretty close, both literally and figuratively.  Luckily they are both really good at what they do.  Which I would say is almost a bad thing because in reality, Aspiration could use about 3 Gunners and 2 Mikes but they both enjoy doing everything so they are  constantly busy.  One of the worries that I had when I first got here was that I would have to really fight to fit myself into their schedules and while that's been true to a certain extent, I feel like they do a good job of not forgetting that I have a job here that's rather separate but still important.  We'll see how it pans out in the months to come.  </p>
<p>Gunner is mildly paranoid about Microsoft and government interference, (most likely due to his affiliation with protest groups) so our office is very pro-open source.  We use Open Office for all of our document needs and we'll soon be transitioning to Ubuntu as the office operating system.  It should be sweet because I've always wanted to get into using Linux but never had the right push to do it.  Other than working on open source programs, I use a lot of tech mailing lists (NTEN, TechSoup, Riders) and blogs (Beth's Blog, Zen and the Art of Nonprofit technology) to stay on top of the nonprofit technology sector.  </p>
<p>Things are going well for the first month and all I can hope is that they stay good when I start getting more into the bulk of what I'll be doing.  Luckily, right now when I'm still learning the ropes, my coworkers have been really helpful and the tool resources that I've come in contact with have saved the day.  Hope everything is going well for everyone!</p>

I just upgraded my notebook to Hardy Heron, the most recent Long-term Support version of Ubuntu, and it's working great.  Hardy loads a nice modern version of Firefox and Flash; they play videos fine (unlike the versions of Firefox and Flash the prior Long-term Support version of Ubuntu loaded).  I briefly brought up the OOo word processor and it seems to work; I think I checked the spreadsheet program the same way.</p>
