				<p>Last week, I returned from NAMAC's 2007 conference in Austin: The Frontier is Here.  Being a dilettante professional relatively new to the field, this conference was a great view from the frontier.  From meeting other media makers and supporters from the ‘old school’ to hanging out with fellow VISTAs working at NAMAC’s member organizations, I was thoroughly ecstatic to have attended. In going forth with my work here at NAMAC, I feel better informed as their new Online Community Manager.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jazminrjones/1685255240/" title="NAMAC/BAVC Youth - photo courtesy of jazminrjones"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2016/1685255240_ce6ebc0756_o.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="namac youth" /></a><br />
NAMAC Youth by jazminrjones<br />
One thing I was particularly sensitive to, was the intergenerational engagement between those from the ‘old school’ and those from the ‘new school’.  While there were many people throughout the conference who had been involved with media far longer than I (some nearly thirty years!) there was a good portion of young people there under twenty. Many of the panels and workshops that the youth presented on were attended mainly by other youth – not as many other, more seasoned professionals.  It would have been nice to have more intergenerational ambassadors to bridge dialogue between the two, perhaps provide some context and mentorship.  I myself am in my late 20s and did my best to connect some of the VISTAs (mostly in their mid-twenties) to other people at the conference as well as each other. </p>

<p>Meeting up with the other VISTAs was excellent and our panel went well. We even had a personal endorsement at the end of our panel from Jack Walsh, co-director at NAMAC.   When I’ve met-up with VISTAs in the past regardless of what state, organization or project they’re from, there’s always been an uncanny feeling of camaraderie. The unique communal support that the CTC VISTA Project provides its members is priceless - both professionally and personally.  Ben Sheldon (now Acting Director of the CTC VISTA Project) in his characteristic salty style, was professionally spot on and attentive with his polished schpiel about the project throughout the conference.  Danielle (Martin) –the unofficial CTC VISTA queen mother – was as supportive as ever to organizations with questions as well as some of the other presenters on the panel.  Her being there on the panel reminded me a bit of when I was in grade school and forgot my lines during a play – I was fortunate enough in that my co-star had some of the lines memorized much better than me, whispering them to me as I stood in that bright, naked spotlight.   </p>
<p>One panel that I found particularly engaging was the panel on place-based media. For this panel, the presenters discussed the relationship and responsibility that media makers in rural and urban contexts have to their communities. Being a media maker myself and having lived in both contexts I felt excited to participate in the dialogue that the panel opened up.   In the discussions that followed, conversations about class, race and community stewardship as the context for mediating between these sites was nothing less than fascinating.  I really enjoyed talking with other media-making ‘in-betweeners’ afterwards. </p>

<p>I must say that the highlight for me was an improvised performance with one of the installation artists at the conference.  At midnight in the conference ballroom, I met with Austin-based video artist <a href="http://michellemayer.com/home.html">Michelle Mayer</a> for an impromptu audio/video jam. Michelle connected her laptop up to the ballroom projector, while I plugged mine in to the main PA.  Using nothing but the built-in mic for my laptop and the live, on-site recordings generated from this, I created rhythmic textures for Mayer to ‘dialogue’ with me using her own library of original and sampled video.  Mayer had an amazing fluency with her manipulations and was an utter joy to perform with. </p>
<p>I feel the collaboration succinctly captured what the conference was all about: creating, engaging and acting.</p>
