				<p>Being almost four months into my second VISTA term, I&#39;ve never had any trouble utilizing our health benefits...until now.<span>  </span>I&#39;m not an overly-ill person or anything, but I&#39;ve used our benefits a number of times.<span>  </span>During my trip back to Indiana for the holiday, I managed to pick up a simple head cold (which also happened last time I went home, so I&#39;m trying to determine the correlation).<span>  </span>Head colds are no biggie at all, but FLYING with one is no picnic.<span>  </span>As a result, I&#39;ve developed a quite painful ear infection.<span>  </span>All I need is a prescription for the infection. </p>
<p>Since I wasn&#39;t smart enough to follow the advice from PSO and select a doctor when I initially moved here, I didn&#39;t have the luxury of calling him/her up to schedule a quick appointment to stop by and quickly remedy the problem.<span>  </span>So I thought &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll hop online and use the Seven Corners provider search to find out what Urgent Care Centers I can go to and just do that.&quot;<span>  </span>Never did I imagine it would turn into an adventure.<span>  </span>My results yielded two care centers, one of which is pediatric only.<span>  </span>(For comparison purposes, I checked Indianapolis - where I was last year - and got 15 results within a 15 mile radius.)<span>  </span>I called them up to confirm the information listed to discover that the information was indeed wrong, but no big deal - they just relocated their office to the same location where the children&#39;s care center is located. </p>
<p>I left the office a little early so I could beat rush hour traffic and begin my adventure.<span>  </span>We arrived at the address for the care center and ventured inside.<span>  </span>Upon walking in, I noticed that the area was crawling with children (all sick in some way - yuck), so I asked if the clinic served adults.<span>  </span>Nope.<span>  </span>The receptionist asked me how old I was (she probably thought I could have been under 18), so I gave her my answer and she confirmed they couldn&#39;t help me.<span>  </span>I asked her where I could go since I had received information about a care center being located there, and she had no idea what I was talking about.<span>  </span>She did, however, give me the card for a clinic located one block north and advised me to try there.<span>  </span>On to stop #2. </p>
<p>We made the short trip to the second clinic and walked in, ready and prepared to be served.<span>  </span>While signing in, the receptionist asked me if I had an appointment, to which I responded &quot;no.&quot;<span>  </span>(I didn&#39;t think you needed appointments at urgent care centers?)<span>  </span>Turns out I couldn&#39;t be seen because I didn&#39;t have an appointment.<span>  </span>She was nice enough, however, to give me a list of clinics that I could try to see if I had better luck elsewhere.<span>  </span>Moving on... </p>
<p>Before going anywhere, I tried calling some of the clinics on the sheet, only to discover that most required appointments to be seen.<span>  </span>(At that point, I wasn&#39;t even thinking about the issue of whether Seven Corners would cover my expenses or not.)<span>  </span>Since it was nearing 5:00 by then, we gave up and went grocery shopping so we could restock our kitchen. </p>
<p>While at Ralph’s, I explained my situation to the pharmacist and asked if he could provide any advise.<span>  </span>He told me about an urgent care center not far from where we were, although he couldn&#39;t tell me an exact name or address.<span>  </span>Upon arriving home, I went to search for it on the internet, with no luck.<span>  </span>I did, however, have luck finding a place just one block from the apartment that was open until 7:00.<span>  </span>It was 6:17;<span>  </span>I still had time to make it before it closed.<span>  </span> </p>
<p>We took a quick walk across the street, and found the place.<span>  </span>&quot;This is it!&quot;<span>  </span>I thought.<span>  </span>But nope, I was wrong.<span>  </span>The receptionist informed me that she couldn&#39;t verify my &quot;insurance&quot; so I would have to be responsible for any charges for the visit until I could find out if they would be covered.<span>  </span>How much?<span>  </span>&quot;At least $175, but could be $250 or more.&quot; <span> </span>Too much.<span>  </span>I left frustrated and in awe of how complicated this had become.<span>  </span>I would have given up by now and just waited out the infection were it not for the fact that it&#39;s one of the most painful ones I&#39;ve had in a while.<span>  </span>I wake up at night in pain and am constantly reminded of it throughout the day.<span>  </span>So I wasn&#39;t ready to give up. </p>
<p>This morning, I called Seven Corners to find out if they covered any other places that weren&#39;t listed online, specifically the place I had tried the night before.<span>  </span>In a nutshell, the response given to me was &quot;If it&#39;s not online, it&#39;s not covered.&quot;<span>  </span>I mentioned that I had tried the only place listed that I could go with no luck, to which I got, &quot;If there is no where in a 35-mile radius of where you are, you can go anywhere.&quot;<span>  </span>Oh.<span>  </span>So I expanded my search to 40 miles (35 wasn&#39;t an option).<span>  </span>I discovered that there are three places all between 26-27 miles from me...but that&#39;s one way and not exactly close.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In an act of desperation, I tried calling the original place again to re-listen to the recording and noticed the suite number given with the address - 150.<span>  </span>Interesting...the suite number for the children&#39;s clinic (in the same building) is 105.<span>  </span>But you would think they would know about it and would have told me about it when I initially asked...but apparently not.<span>  </span>So today after work, I&#39;m going to try going back to the first building we tried to try to find the clinic.<span>  </span>Wish me luck!!<span>  </span>I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do if this doesn&#39;t work out...maybe I&#39;m just spoiled.</p>

	    <p>Thanks, Carl!  I put up Part II yesterday in case you&#39;re wondering how things (hopefully) ended.  I&#39;m glad I encouraged you to find a place before you&#39;ll need it as well!</p>
