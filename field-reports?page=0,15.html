				<p>A lot of the work at the CTC VISTA Project is getting information back from our VISTAs and their supervisors.  I've been trying out two different Survey Services and I thought I would post some of my opinions on them.</p>
<p>Basically, we have a lot of questions that can take the form of a survey/poll.  Recently I created one to ask what VISTAs are coming to the NTEN conference, and a regular one (well, I've done it twice now) for supervisor's to complete as a brief monthly report.  It's basically a bunch of formatted questions with---the best part---a way to put in everyone's email address and then easily see who has filled it out and who I have to call and bug, err, check-in with.</p>
<p>*<a href="http://surveymonkey.com">Survey Monkey</a> - This is the most common one that people say when you ask "what should I use to make this online survey?".  It works, but it's kind've ugly, clunky, and you don't have a lot of options for styling (no html!).  But it lets you make a pretty complicated survey with different pages and paths (eg. If you answered "no" to #1, skip #2 and go to #3).</p>
<p>*<a href="http://wufoo.com">Wufoo</a> - Just by the name you know it's going to be colorful and shiny.  Which it is.  Everything is all clean and crisp and fancy feeling.  You can customize all the styles with html and CSS and they offer lovely reports.  But the surveys are kind've limited in layout.  It's all on a single page.  Also, while all high-tech, it has some non-user centric features.  The most irritating of which is that help-text only shows up when hover over the form, making it easy to miss, or hard to scan the entire survey at a glance.</p>
<p>Both of them cost money if you're trying to do anything more than dead simple, which is to be expected.  I've looked around for Free options, but haven't found anything that has that option to see who '''hasn't''' responded.  But they make collecting information very convenient---though you still have to act on it.  As always, technology is cheap, thinking is hard.</p>

				<p>So, long time no post. I was going to talk about one of the things I've been working on, which is IPv6. This'll take a little bit of background explanation, so if you're already tech savvy and know all about IPv6 just bear with me.</p>
<p>You probably have at least some idea of how the Internet works. Virtually every computer or device connected to the Internet (or just about any computer network really) is assigned an address, known as an "Internet Protocol" (or IP) address. These IP addresses are usually represented by a string of four numbers between 0 and 255 separated by dots, like 74.134.239.209. Computers on a network send packets of information much like you or I would address a letter. The packet is addressed with the number of the computer that it wants to send the information to (like a web browser requesting a copy of a webpage) and sends the packet on its way. That packet makes its way to the target computer, which reads the information and puts it to whatever use was intended (like processing the correct webpage and sending it back to the web browser). Exciting, eh?</p>
<p>The version of the Internet Protocol that we use is known as version 4, and has been in use since 1981, and has worked well. However, we are in perilous danger of exhausting the total number of unique address numbers available. There are only 4,294,967,296 unique addresses available using the current standard. This might seem like a lot, but consider that it is not even close to as many addresses are there are people in the world (~6.5 billion). Now think of how many Internet-connected computers and devices there are in  the world, each of which possess one or more IP addresses. Furthermore, there are millions of those addresses which are reserved for special purposes, like private networks, multicasting, and other network-architecture related functions. So our available address space suddenly seems quite small. In fact, current estimates of address exhaustion place the time that we run our of unique addresses at sometime in the first half of the year 2010, at which point without a solution architectural growth of the Internet will come to a halt. This situation is what is known in technical terms as Not Good.</p>
<p>Enter IPv6. IPv6 is the next version of the Internet Protocol (IPv5 was an experimental streaming protocol that was designed to complement IPv4 but was never used). In the words of Bill Nye, IPv6 is Really Bigly Hugely Big. The address space is so large (2^128 addresses) that it's difficult to even adequately describe, so I'll attempt to do so with a series of metaphors I found on Wikipedia and elsewhere. IPv6 has roughly 50 octillion addresses (a 5 with 28 zeros after it) for each person on Earth. If the population of the Earth were 18 quintillion, there would be about 18 quintillion addresses for each of them. If the IPv4 address space were the volume of an iPod, then the IPv6 space would be the size of the entire Earth. I especially like this one: there are a million times as many IPv6 addresses as there are IPv4 addresses...for each star in the known universe. </p>
<p>So you get the idea. IPv6 is big, and should last us for a while. It also solves a lot of problems that IPv4 has introduced. In order to stave-off address exhaustion, various network technologies have been introduced which break the end-to-end nature of the Internet. Originally, the intent was for the Internet to be the great non-hierarchical redundant network, with every single Internet-connected computer (or "Host") with an unbroken two-way path to every other host. However, technologies like Network Address Translation (NAT) have been introduced which allow hosts to share "public" (visible to the rest of the Internet) addresses. This is why if you've ever looked at the network settings on your laptop when you're out at a café or something, your address always seems to be 192.168.blah.blah or something similar (maybe 172.16.blah.blah). These are addresses set aside for "private networks," which are networks which are never visible to the rest of the Internet. Probably the café only has one IP, which it shares with all of its clients. The end-to-end path is broken, because a set of hosts are behind a hierarchical structure made by NAT. Often there is a similar situation at home, where all clients of an ISP are behind the ISP's NAT. This makes it difficult if not impossible for you to publish content to the Internet without utilizing third-party services and websites, or paying ISPs extra money for "business class" services on top of what you pay for bandwidth.</p>
<p>What's more, that one address is probably "dynamic" rather than "static." That means that the café's Internet Service Provider (and probably your ISP at home) assigns an address to them dynamically from a common pool as they become available. Why is this a problem? Well, it's not, unless you want to provide content, like a website. A protocol called Domain Name Service (or DNS) assigns human readable addresses (like ctcvista.org) to IP addresses (like 208.113.151.31) based on a database of those pairings. If ctcvista.org had a dynamic address, then if the ISP decided to change it to 208.113.151.32, ctcvista.org would no longer point to the right place and no one would be able to find the website. This means that in order to have a website, people have to pay hosting providers for space on computers that have expensive static IPs that don't change.</p>
<p>Still with me? Okay, so IPv6 can solve these problems by assigning a public, static IP to every device on Earth. However, who gets to assign the addresses? Currently, all the IP addresses on Earth are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). IANA delegates that responsibility to organizations in charge of large geographical areas. So all of the addresses in North America are assigned by the American Registry of Internet Names and Numbers (ARIN). ARIN allocates ranges of IP address numbers called "blocks" to qualifying organizations, mainly large ISPs. This makes sense in a way, because ISPs provide the connectivity and it is architecturally simplest for the assigned numbers to reflect the actual structure of the networks that make up the Internet.</p>
<p>However, there are a large number of community projects that require a large number of addresses but don't fit into the established model. These are projects like community networks, municipal wireless networks, community technology centers, and community-run ISPs. These groups are often short on cash but need a large number of addresses for all of their computers, devices, and members. But even though there are a huge number of addresses available, they still have to pay an arm and a leg to go through the large ISPs that maintain a stranglehold on the address space as if it were still running out.</p>
<p>So, finally, enter my organization, Acorn. Acorn is working with ARIN to do two things:<br />
1. Get a large allocation of addresses that Acorn can then hand out to community projects that need them without them having to go through the big ISPs.<br />
2. Change the policy so that in the future any other organization can do the same thing.</p>
<p>Number one is accomplished. Acorn's been awarded a /32 block, which is 2^92 addresses. Billions and billions, to say the least. Now we're working on a policy proposal for early next year which, if ratified, will set up a procedure for other community organizations to get their own IP addresses to provide services to the people in their neighborhoods without having to go through the ISPs for anything but connectivity. Hopefully with this work, we can make the Internet become a better, fairer place like it was intended to be before the critical date in 2010 before IPv4 runs out.</p>
<p>So I hope that this is a fairly straightforward explanation while still being accurate. I'm far from being the world's foremost expert on Internet architecture, so if I got any points wrong feel free to correct me.</p>

				<p>I'm still working on the generic CMS.</p>
<p>CCTS appears to be asserting a copyright in the entire CMS code.  I'm not saying that necessarily goes against VISTA goals or my own.  Ownership of the code may be an important part of their leverage for getting paid by clients, and getting paid is what makes it possible for CCTS to continue to serve (and perhaps even grow in capacity to produce more benefit per year for clients).</p>
<p>Although the CMS will have a generic or reference copy, CCTS may make customized versions of it for specific clients.  This is where using Ruby on Rails (instead of PHP, as Drupal uses) as the underpinning may pay off, I suspect.</p>

I have been making some progress with the HELP Drupal web site. The test site is at <a href="http://wcni.helpofojai.org" title="http://wcni.helpofojai.org">http://wcni.helpofojai.org</a> . I managed to get tinyMCE working and loaded the Nice Menu module and a few pics. I may call upon you Drupal folks for some help after all the basic site info is input.<br />
I have some time before the PC lab opens again and we start doing classes to work on the site</p>

Great to hear you're getting the hang of Drupal.  It took me two weeks of being locked away in a room with no windows to understand Drupal (definitely not a programmer by training). The site looks great so far.</p>

	    <p>Man, Kevin did it in two weeks?  Took me about a month to get the basics down.  And I'm still learning cool stuff.  The only difference now, is that i know which modules do what and a am a little better at figuring out how to leverage which modules in conjunction with each other to work/achieve what my org wants.</p>
<p>I went at checked out the site Jim and it looks GREAT.  SUCH a huge difference over the old one AND built by a Drupal 'newbie'.  Certainly don't hesitate to drop us a line individually here at HQ with questions you may have - we're all big Drupal geeks here.  Of course, don't underestimate the knowledge of your fellow VISTAs too.  Many of them are also Drupalistas and may be able to answer your questions more quickly on the listserv than by us via individual email.</p>

				<p>I'm finally starting to get into the nitty gritty with the different youth teams at HSTF. For the 8th grade entrepreneurs, I put together a SpongeBob-themed PowerPoint presentation to demonstrate to them what their presentation will be once they've chosen the product or service they want to sell (the program includes a presentation phase where they present to the program directors to get funding for their product). I'll be giving the presentation this Thursday and after that I'll be working with a few of the entrepreneurs and teaching them how to use PowerPoint so they can make their own professional looking presentation. </p>
<p>I'm also working with some of the Youth Community Organizers (whose work I'm finding to be very inspiring). They plan to make a PSO-type video for their campaign to get civics as a required class in Boston Public Schools. They recently organized a hearing at Boston City Hall, you should <a href="http://hydesquare.org/news_and_events/highlights/Partnerships/article1.html">check this out</a> for highlights if you're interested. I made that page and filmed the video by the way (filming was a bit choppy, it was my first time)!</p>
<p>My only real complaint about work here now is that people still think I'm here for tech support, which is something I'm happy to help out with, but isn't really my main job here. It's just frustrating when people come to me with tech problems and I'm unable to help them because it makes me seem incompetent. </p>
<p>Still trying to think of creative ways to integrate digital media and technology into the other youth programs. Things are getting more fun around here.</p>

<p>It's definitely hard to shake the tech support label as a CTC VISTA. Some of it comes with the territory but it gets frustrating like you said (especially seeming incompetent). Is there anyone else there who can do tech stuff? What'd they do for tech assistance before you got there?</p>

	    <p>There's a guy who comes in once a week who I chill with and try to learn stuff from. He's definitely been helpful. But anytime he's not here people come to me.

<p>This past Friday I had the quiet pleasure of visiting one of our program sites, the <a href="http://www.otxwest.org/" target="blank">Oakland Technology Exchange</a>.  I had the opportunity to hang out there for nearly two hours talking shop with one of our VISTAs, Naomi Jimenez.  I also got to visit a VISTA Alumni from my class, Jeff Benton AND even had a surprise visit from <a href="http://oaklanddusty.org/" target="blank">D.U.S.T.Y.</a>  Director and Co-Founder, Michaelangelo James, who won the 2006 <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/what/initiatives/tonistoneaward.htm" target="blank">Toni Stone Innovative Initiative Award</a> at the CTCNet Conference I attended during my first VISTA year!</p>
<p>When I arrived, I was warmly greeted by Jeff Benton who walked me in and gave<br />
me a brief tour of the OTX computer recycling warehouse. From OTX's website, "OTX-West is dedicated to eliminating the digital divide in Oakland, California. [They] do this by refurbishing surplus computers, educating families and providing ongoing access and support to those who have received our computers. The experiences of OTX-West over the past 6 years has [sic] demonstrated both the need for home computers in the community and the reuse model as a green way to meet the need."<br />
  <br /><br />
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/memeshift/1997135966/" title="The OTX Warehouse Floor by memeshift, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2134/1997135966_e2746faac3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="The OTX Warehouse Floor" /></a><br />
Their warehouse was stacked full of old computers and hardware from all around the Bay Area. Bits of circuit boards, mice, keyboards, towers, monitors, hard drives and just about any other computer component you can think of were stacked, strewn and than stacked again about the warehouse creating mazes of a reused technological past awaiting to build the future. In deed, OTX's mission statement proudly claims, "Reusing the past...to build the future". <br /><br />
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/memeshift/1997133926/" title="Noami Jimenez and me by memeshift, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2087/1997133926_d7247a2195.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Noami Jimenez and me" /></a><br />
  At the center of all of this was CTC VISTA Naomi Jimenez.  Before I met Naomi, I had the pleasure of reading Danielle Martin's copious notes on previous conference calls with Naomi and was pleasantly affirmed in my positive proclivities to Naomi.   From her reiterations on the necessity of recycling technology for a sound ecological, political and economic future, to her beaming proudly while explaining the so called 'grunt work' she had done there as a VISTA,  it was clear that Naomi embodied the very spirit of what OTX was all about.  I could tell by the way the staff interacted with her that she was a very valuable asset to OTX.<br />
  <br /><br />
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/memeshift/1997128920/" title="On the Importance of Reusing Computers for a Sound Ecological Future by memeshift, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2142/1997128920_4c5bbc08c4.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="On the Importance of Reusing Computers for a Sound Ecological Future" /></a><br />
  The continued tour Naomi gave me was wonderful.  We walked about the warehouse and Naomi showed me many of the other rooms and spaces at OTX's facility.  From the ghosting stations opposite the 'store' where people could 'pay' for refurbished computers with volunteer time to the 'mini-museum' of old Commodores and Atari computers near the kids room (where parents could leave their kids so they could volunteer and take classes!) -  I was treated to a very comprehensive tour. As a former Food Bank Warehouse Operations Coordinator (who's now a CTC VISTA!),  I was duly impressed by the tight integration of recycling and reusing supposed 'technological detritus' with community empowerment.  OTX is in deed a wonderful example of community technology at it's finest.<br />
  <br /><br />
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/memeshift/1997134696/" title="Michaelangelo James and me by memeshift, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2299/1997134696_2dd16e1075.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Michaelangelo James and me" /></a><br />
  As a final treat, we had a surprise visit from Michaelangelo James, Co-founder and Executive Director of Digital Underground Storytelling For Youth (D.U.S.T.Y.).  I first met, Michaelangelo at the 2006 CTCNet Conference in Washington D.C. where he was presented with their annual Toni Stone Innovative Initiative Award.  He was simply dropping some computers off to get looked at but ended up staying a bit to watch an innovative digital story that Naomi had created using nothing but Audacity and Open Office's Impress - another shining example of what VISTAs can create with limited resources - which as we all know, many non-profits need, D.U.S.T.Y. notwithstanding.  As a VISTA myself, I of course took the opportunity to tell Michaelangelo a bit about the CTC VISTA project and the possible placement of one with his org.  For now however, that shall the topic of another field report...</p>
<p>Until next time, this is Morgan Sully reporting straight from Oakland signing off.</p>
<p>peace!</p>

				<p>The NAMAC conference was an experience.  It was great to reconnect with CTC VISTA Project peeps, learn about new media arts happenings and experience a great new city.  It is hard to say how the conference was overall.  Each panel was completely different from the next, and hardly seemed related to the previous one.  Some I attended hardly seemed related to anything I am working on at my organization, but still interesting to learn about.  Being in a temporary volunteer position at a media arts organization, I attended this conference as an observer, quietly deciding if this is really what I am interested in and thinking about where the media arts could fall in my life path.  This description of the conference applies to the back of my mind.  The front of my mind got inspired to create Spanish camera classes to add to our curriculum, after attending a Latino media art panel.  At this panel we (my supervisor and I) networked with an independent Latina filmmaker and discussed screening her film at our theater.  She is interested in making an appearance, which would really turn the film showing into an event.  Exciting and in the works.  Texas is cool.</p>
<p>I am currently working on a gig at another middle school with the MOLLIE project.  It has honestly felt like I am on a game show.  We pile into a van loaded with video equipment and road trip it out to a school.  We show up, the kids get pumped and greet us with helping hands.  The topic of the video is unknown right up until the clock starts running.  I meet these young people, and have 1.5 hours to interpret their storyboards, create a set with any resource I can find in the classroom, create a short storyline and remember to include newly learned facts about things such as volcanoes, earthquakes, surface water, anything that falls under the broad topic of earth science.  While trying to envision the end product I am in charge of overseeing that every kid gets their hands on the cameras and mics, and that they learned a bit about production.  At the end of the 1.5, a new group comes in and we do it all over again.  It is a quick three hours.</p>
<p>I split my time between the education department and the Wealthy Theater.  Duties at the Wealthy Theater are increasing.  I have become the go-to girl for lighting info.  I am currently working on a database for all of our lighting equipment that has been sitting and not accounted for for the past however many years.  I am researching new equipment, and creating new light scenes for any event we may have in the future.  I run the light board for every event we put on.  There is no manual for our board, and I spend a lot of my time researching and testing to get things right.  It is slow and grueling at times, but it feels great to go to work and be in self-learning mode.  My goal is to have a manual ready for any new member or staff person to come in and look at to learn the lighting skills and help out with community events.  Curriculum for a lighting class is in the future, too.  I was also recently brought on board to the administrative team of the theater.  I help with securing future events, which is necessary to sustain the life of the theater.  We are currently battling with the GR police department to obtain a club license.  If we win, this will ensure a longer lifespan for us. </p>
<p>Things are busy, and good.  Happy Monday!</p>

<p>Too bad they're not keeping you bust at GRCMC! That entire van production process was exhausting just to read but sounds awesome. Any chance you've taped the whole process? </p>
<p>In terms of real world skills, knowing how to get a club license may be the coolest skill learned by a VISTA so far this year. </p>

				<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>So I'm going to continue being good and write a second update report.</p>
<p>When do you finally settle in to an organization?  This question is more rhetorical than anything else.  I think I'll still be settling until my last day there.  Either that or it will remain unsettled.  Who knows?</p>
<p>In the wake of my supervisor leaving, it has left everything more helter-skelter than usual.  (By the way, I <em>hate</em> helter-skelter things with a burning passion.)  This has resulted in me being the bug-fixer for the new website which has given me victories such as modifying my first PHP doc to quandaries such as being expected to modify an RSS feed in that same doc.</p>
<p>I had a good talk with my boss last Monday about being 5 months into the program and what I expected out of the next 7 months.  I told her all of the tasks that I had been assigned (some of which she was unaware of) and how I could only put in 40 hours a week since I don't have an internet connection at my apartment yet.  (I know that we are only supposed to work 40 hours a week and I'm behind that all of the way, but it's good to have some flexibility in that as well as the option to work extra <em>if</em> you want to.)</p>
<p>One of my big contentions with the talk was that I wanted to make sure that I was making finished products and adding to my technical skillset.  The latter makes almost obvious sense professionally as well as personally.  The former element has those as well, but there is also a morale element at work, as well.  It takes away from your will to work if you don't have something that you can proudly say you did.  I'm guessing this is a big issue in the nonprofit world, but I don't want that to prevent me from having the best possible experience with my organization that I can have.</p>
<p>When you're assigned to work with an organization, you can't expect them to take you by the hand, set you at a desk, and guide you along the way to work for a better tomorrow (or whatever).  You have to pull yourself along and take a more active role in it than you might have thought originally.  There is not only the work.  There is also the value of it and the negotiations of managing where you work, how you work, who you work with, what you work on, what you get out of your work, etc. etc.  (Let's not even mention the stuff that you have to deal with outside of your work.)  That's some serious multitasking and also one of the biggest challenges I've faced being a VISTA.</p>
<p>So here I am, typing in my report at the Chicago Public Library by my house and thinking about what I need to do now and what I want to do later.  It can get a little daunting, but I'm doing things little by little so it doesn't get overwhelming.  I'm getting stuff done, tomorrow is another day, and all that jazz.</p>

Sounds like you're negotiating the telecommuniting aspect of your job pretty well. Any chance you'd like to contribute an article-style description of some pointers and how-to's of successful telecommuting/multitasking for a field survival guide for CTC VISTA's? Enjoy the library and good luck getting a connection at your place!</p>

				<p>Hello All,<br />
It's been awhile since I submitted a field report.</p>
<p>Frustration with funding has been a bit of an issue here. We are building out the organization in a very big way which has been challenging. I had our new computer lab up and running and then had to shut it down while we wait for an additional permit from the County (soon) to fully utilize our large, new site. This has caused a bit of a catch 22 as we need tenets to move in to generate revenue. </p>
<p>I am new to non profits and things run much different than in the corporate world! Anyway, I also have been tasked to refresh our very stale and inaccurate website. Our various programs have been very good about sending me fresh information and present names of program directors after and appeal email to all!</p>
<p>Drupal 5.3 is running on my local Windows machine with a theme called "Beale Street" (in green) which we like alot. It has suckerfisfish menus as well as rollovers. I spoke with our Network Administrator and he is getting it running on our LAMP server outside the DMZ so a test site can be reached from the Internet.</p>
<p>Drupal Masters, I could use your help! I can create accounts that can login and modify the site if I have any volunteers? I would like to see a Drupal Forum on the Vista Site. What do you think?</p>
<p>Thanks all, Happy Holidays!<br />
Jim</p>

				<p>In late October, I flew out to San Jose to attend the MuniWireless '07 Silicon Valley conference. As a VISTA I run a project that provides free wireless Internet access to low-income residents of subsidized housing in Boston's South End neighborhood. Ours is not so much a municipal wireless project as a community wireless project, a distinction that the conference helped me understand, but nonetheless, those of us interested in building smaller-scale "grassroots" networks designed to serve smaller communities such as housing developments can learn a great deal from the MuniWireless experience.</p>
<p>1. What is the purpose of municipal wireless and how is it different than community wifi efforts?</p>
<p>High-speed Internet access is and will continue to have a transformative impact on our economy analogous to that of the Interstate Highway System after it was built in the '50s. Eisenhower sold the expensive highway project to the American public as a military necessity, a solution to the military's difficulties transferring masses of troops and equipment across a vast country during wartime. However, although promoted as a military project, the highways were of course used to carry all sorts of traffic, from passenger cars to 18-wheeler trucks. By changing the way Americans traveled and moved goods, the highways also led to major changes in the way we lived and conducted business.</p>
<p>Ubiquitous access to broadband may have an analogous impact. Voice and video communications can be encoded into data and transmitted via the Internet. The days when we could purchase TV service from a cable company or a satellite company and telephone service from a phone company are over. One company can provide each family with a high-speed connection capable of carrying telephone calls, TV service, and Internet access all at once. </p>
<p>Yet many technologists worry that broadband penetration in the United States is lagging behind other industrialized countries. One cause for this is the relative lack of competition in the American broadband market. In America, consumers can choose between a cable company and a phone company when it comes to access, and this duopoly leads to higher prices and lower speeds relative to the rest of the world. According to a study published two years ago, a 100Mbps connection in Japan cost $22 a month, while a 26Mbps connection in France cost the equivalent of $36 monthly. Today, I pay about $25 a month for a 768Kbps connection at my home in Boston.</p>
<p>Municipal wireless can provide an alternative to the cable/DSL duopoly for a city or region. Installing wireless radios is much cheaper than laying down fiber. Both MuniWIreless and community wireless efforts take advantage of this fact, and both seek to alleviate the "digital divide", which arises when low-income populations cannot afford the high price of broadband access. However, the primary distinctions between MuniWireless and community wireless is that municipal efforts seek to provide ubiquitous access for a large area (or at least for the outdoors areas as we'll discuss later) and to deploy infrastructure that will enable them to compete with existing Internet Service Providers. Community wireless projects serve much smaller communities, such as housing developments or individual buildings, rather than wide areas. Such small-scale efforts typically buy and redistribute inexpensive Internet connections from the same companies municipal networks seek to undercut. </p>
<p>One important characteristic of WiFi, the technology now in use for both MuniWireless and community wireless projects, is that it has a relatively weak signal. Unlike, say, shortwave radio, which can be transmitted across the globe, WiFi can be flaky. It doesn't travel through walls very well. As a result, municipal wireless projects have found that guaranteeing access inside buildings is prohibitively expensive, and many projects now aim to reach only up to the windows of a building, although users of the network can deploy repeaters to enhance the signal enough to provide indoor coverage. Community WiFi efforts, by contrast, typically aim to provide access throughout a building, so that resident's can connect to the network from their desktop or laptop computers.</p>
<p>2. What is the state of the municipal wireless market?</p>
<p>The conference I attended was titled "industry at a crossroads", and this was probably putting it politely. One presenter noted that his mother doesn't understand what he does for a living, but she feels bad for him as a result of all of the recent bad press about municipal wireless projects falling apart. Over the summer, some of the largest projects in the country, including those in Chicago and San Francisco were cancelled, scaled back or otherwise reevaluated.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for the recent stumbles. A new technology called WiMax will provide far greater improvements in wireless power and range when it debuts to the public in the next few years, and nobody wants to spend millions building a network that might be obsolete soon. Additionally, there are legitimate questions about whether public-sector projects should be competing with private-sector telecommunications companies, concerns that are beyond the scope of this article. </p>
<p>The biggest stumbling block at this point, however, is that providing ubiquitous WiFi coverage, while still less expensive than deploying wired infrastructure, can cost $100,000 to $300,000 a square mile, and without strong a business case demonstrating how the investment will pay off, funders have been hesitant to commit millions of dollars. Politicians have been eager to promise free or cheap broadband access to the public, but with Internet Service Providers already notorious for their slim margins, it is difficult to see how municipal projects can recoup their initial costs while undercutting ISPs on price and living up to the lofty civic goals that accompany public projects, such as providing open access to all partners.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that digital inclusion projects will have positive economic benefits in the long term. By providing free WiFi in the South End, we are enabling an underserved community to become technology users for the first time, helping to create a market that did not exist before. Unfortunately, the exact economic and social impact of what we are doing is amorphous and difficult to quantify. It is very shaky ground on which to base the rationale for building a multimillion dollar public project.</p>
<p>That's why digital inclusion, when it was mentioned at all during the MuniWireless conference, always seemed to be the last item on everyone's agenda. The industry has very quickly shifted to a new sales pitch for municipal wireless networks. Now, the idea is to use this new infrastructure to improve public safety and to reduce the cost of delivering municipal services. Specifically, a wireless network can be a platform for video surveillance cameras to monitor high-crime neighborhoods. Auditory sensors, such as the SpotShotter technology currently being deployed in Dorchester, can be placed around a neighborhood and can alert police when a gun is fired. The sensors are advanced enough to distinguish between a firecracker, a pistol and a rifle, pinpoint the exact location of the shot, and swivel cameras towards the scene, so that police will already have reviewed live video of the location in their cars before they arrive. A second, less exciting application, involves enabling municipal employees such as cops and building inspectors to submit reports from wireless devices out in the field, so they never have to waste time traveling to and from the office. It has always been easier to fund anti-crime projects than anti-poverty projects, making the first scenario far more attractive to funders than using a wireless network to ease the digital divide. The second scenario, offers municipalities an easy means of calculating the potential financial windfall that a wireless network will provide, and, in contrast to digital inclusion ideas that promise to increase economic activity in the future, that windfall comes directly from the city's budget.</p>
<p>The ambitious wireless projects that are deployed over the next few years, will be funded principally by an "anchor tenant", namely a government bureaucracy interested in using the network to achieve specific goals, such as improved public safety, or lower costs of providing civic services. But just as the Interstate Highway System was sold to the public as a defense project, but ended up carrying primarily civilian traffic, there is no reason to believe that municipal wireless networks, once deployed, cannot be useful for digital inclusion, increasing broadband penetration, and other purposes.</p>
<p>3. How should community groups interested in digital inclusion approach municipal wireless projects?</p>
<p>Non-profits and other community wireless projects should not see municipal wireless as a competitor, but as a platform for us to build on. When a municipal wireless network is built, the role of community wireless developers should be to deploy inexpensive technology that takes the municipal networks signal from the street and deliver it into the apartments of our constituents. A citywide effort of business leaders will quickly lose sight of the needs of underserved communities, which are inexpensive Internet access combined with inexpensive computer training and computer repair services provided by members of the community to their peers.</p>
<p>The HUD "Community Technology Centers" serve as an extraordinary resource for municipal networks. These institutions are already providing the necessary skills training, equipment donation and repair programs that will enable poor users to take advantage of municipal wireless networks. Because the infrastructure will already have been paid for by the anchor tenant, municipal network operators should be able to provide excess bandwidth at little or no cost to community groups, eliminating the need for those organizations to buy bandwidth from ISPs. The costs of providing access will then become so inexpensive (say $50 per family for a $100 router that can serve four families as well as other infrastructure, repair and training programs) that with a little grant money, community wireless groups should be able to achieve self-sufficiency with a combination of low access fees (say $5 a month) and advertising that is conducted in a tasteful and unobtrusive manner. These are of course back of the envelope calculations, but even if municipal networks refuse to provide free or cheap access to non-profits, their very existence will still help by forcing ISPs to lower broadband prices. </p>
<p>In the end, if municipalities and their partners can justify the cost of building municipal wireless networks, then non-profits, underserved communities and the public as a whole will be able to benefit from telecommunications infrastructure that is owned by the public and intended to be utilized for the public good.</p>
<p>(I intend on writing another blog post later to discuss the lessons that non-profits and community groups can take away from the muniwireless experience).</p>

				<p>Okay, I don't know about anyone else but can you believe it's already November. Wow for those of us that started in January we are almost done. Look back over this year; this has been an absolute wonderful experience. I've learned so much and feel that I have accomplished quiet a bit.<br />
I've visited nine museums in Eastern Washington so far and have three more scheduled. It's amazing how such small organizations can do so much.  I've added ten new contributors to our Inland Northwest Memories Project. And it continues to grow.<br />
I've worked with Middle School students after school to teach them to conduct oral history interviews which will start up again next week.<br />
This weekend we are hosting a Veteran's Day Event that I have been completely in charge of. I've learned a lot about getting all my ducks in a row.<br />
Finally, we've reached a lull in grant applications. I've worked on five this year so far, mainly doing research.<br />
I'm already planning on staying on another year and my organization fully supports me in this decision.</p>

				<p>Last week, I returned from NAMAC's 2007 conference in Austin: The Frontier is Here.  Being a dilettante professional relatively new to the field, this conference was a great view from the frontier.  From meeting other media makers and supporters from the ‘old school’ to hanging out with fellow VISTAs working at NAMAC’s member organizations, I was thoroughly ecstatic to have attended. In going forth with my work here at NAMAC, I feel better informed as their new Online Community Manager.</p>

One thing I was particularly sensitive to, was the intergenerational engagement between those from the ‘old school’ and those from the ‘new school’.  While there were many people throughout the conference who had been involved with media far longer than I (some nearly thirty years!) there was a good portion of young people there under twenty. Many of the panels and workshops that the youth presented on were attended mainly by other youth – not as many other, more seasoned professionals.  It would have been nice to have more intergenerational ambassadors to bridge dialogue between the two, perhaps provide some context and mentorship.  I myself am in my late 20s and did my best to connect some of the VISTAs (mostly in their mid-twenties) to other people at the conference as well as each other. </p>

<p>Meeting up with the other VISTAs was excellent and our panel went well. We even had a personal endorsement at the end of our panel from Jack Walsh, co-director at NAMAC.   When I’ve met-up with VISTAs in the past regardless of what state, organization or project they’re from, there’s always been an uncanny feeling of camaraderie. The unique communal support that the CTC VISTA Project provides its members is priceless - both professionally and personally.  Ben Sheldon (now Acting Director of the CTC VISTA Project) in his characteristic salty style, was professionally spot on and attentive with his polished schpiel about the project throughout the conference.  Danielle (Martin) –the unofficial CTC VISTA queen mother – was as supportive as ever to organizations with questions as well as some of the other presenters on the panel.  Her being there on the panel reminded me a bit of when I was in grade school and forgot my lines during a play – I was fortunate enough in that my co-star had some of the lines memorized much better than me, whispering them to me as I stood in that bright, naked spotlight.   </p>
<p>One panel that I found particularly engaging was the panel on place-based media. For this panel, the presenters discussed the relationship and responsibility that media makers in rural and urban contexts have to their communities. Being a media maker myself and having lived in both contexts I felt excited to participate in the dialogue that the panel opened up.   In the discussions that followed, conversations about class, race and community stewardship as the context for mediating between these sites was nothing less than fascinating.  I really enjoyed talking with other media-making ‘in-betweeners’ afterwards. </p>

Me jamming with Michelle Mayer (thanks again for this pic too Danielle!)</p>
<p>I must say that the highlight for me was an improvised performance with one of the installation artists at the conference.  At midnight in the conference ballroom, I met with Austin-based video artist <a href="http://michellemayer.com/home.html">Michelle Mayer</a> for an impromptu audio/video jam. Michelle connected her laptop up to the ballroom projector, while I plugged mine in to the main PA.  Using nothing but the built-in mic for my laptop and the live, on-site recordings generated from this, I created rhythmic textures for Mayer to ‘dialogue’ with me using her own library of original and sampled video.  Mayer had an amazing fluency with her manipulations and was an utter joy to perform with. </p>
<p>I feel the collaboration succinctly captured what the conference was all about: creating, engaging and acting.</p>

				<p>I am participating in the development, in Ruby on Rails, of a generic Content Management System (CMS) and a library that lets administrators edit documents that use styles and can be displayed to the public (or a smaller audience) over the Web.  My current task is to make sure that when a server using this library exchanges the identifiers of documents and components with the browser, it encrypts the identifiers so that no user can falsify her right to see and edit those documents and components.</p>
<p>Am I the only CTC VISTA who uses the Ruby programming language?</p>
<p>The rest of this posting could be regarded as an appendix for those who want to look in some depth at what I have done so far.</p>
<p>I attach code that unit-tests a module I wrote to encrypt and decrypt IDs.  The testing code uses a package called "rspec", that promotes a style where your testing code is also a description in almost plain English of what the module under test is supposed to accomplish from the viewpoint of its callers.</p>
<p>Here is some explanation about the code I attached.</p>
<p>I wrote a class called CapabilityKey.  An instance is a randomly chosen key that can be used to encrypt and decrypt identifiers.  The code reflects my use of a jargon that refers to an encrypted identifier as a "capability", because, when you (a person or a process on some computer) have it in hand, it denotes your capability or right to access or edit some resource.  This jargon occurs in the literature.</p>
<p>In this context, the type of an identifer is simply integer, and it is what is stored in the database to identify the records representing the resources we are protecting.  The simple and naive way to identify the resources in interactions between the server and the browser would be simply to send the id.</p>
<p>Maybe I will rename the class as CapabilityLock because a lot of what it does is make sure that the "capability", when used actually as a key, fits the lock, that is, is valid in the context in which someone is attempting to use it.  Really, the term "key" refers better to the capability than to the thing I called a key in this code, which is really more the lock.  In fact, some of the literature about capabilities refers to them as keys.  They function very much like a car key.  You shouldn't be able to drive a given car anywhere unless you have the key.</p>
<p>The testing code that I attach refers to the fact that my class or one of its instances should satisfy the following "shoulds", each of which I now try to make a little plainer as to its meaning than the code does:</p>
<p>it "Should support instances being marshaled."</p>
<p>This means that the regular "marshaling" facility included with Ruby should be able to save off a representation of an instance of my class to a file and should be able to correctly recover a usable copy from such a saved copy.</p>
<p>it "Should supply a capability that is a string."</p>
<p>This means that when we give an instance an identifier and say we want back an encrypted version of that identifier, the data type of the resulting "capability" should be String.</p>
<p>it "Should recover the correct id and tag from a valid capability."</p>
<p>This says that when I give an instance an identifier and ask it for a capability, and if I give the same instance back the capability and ask it for the id that that capability denotes, it should give me back the correct id.  (Another piece of data, a "tag", is also tagging along with the id in these operations, but we don't need to get into that here).</p>
<p>it "Should detect invalid capabilities in the vast majority of cases."</p>
<p>This test case is an attempt to see whether it is, as it should be, very unlikely that someone dinking around could generate some string that would look like a valid capability to the lock.  The way I test that is by creating 1000 locks and trying one key (or "capability") in them that they didn't generate, but that another lock did generate.  Each creation of a lock uses the pseudorandom number generator to determine the characteristic of the lock.  I consider this test quite equivalent to generating 1000 keys at random and testing them in one lock, although I am really doing the other way around.  So, it's at least some way to give confidence that the wrong key won't fit the wrong lock, and this in turn gives some confidence that it would be hard to carve a key and get it to work in a given lock.  No doubt a cryptologist would say that such a test is far from perfect.  The cryptologist could argue, for example, that for all she can tell from the test cases, the locks might be generating capabilities that all begin with "foo", and the locks might be accepting any string starting with "bar:" as a valid capability, for example, "bar:33" as a capability to ID=33.  Testing can't test everything, when it comes to cryptographic strength.  But this test at least gives some rudimentary indication that the locks won't take each others' keys.</p>

	    <p>Hey Jack,<br />
This looks like completely obscure work to me, but I am glad that you can find poetry in Ruby's coding.   In my own work with CSS I have come to appreciate simple, shorthand ways to instruct browsers to render styles for a webpage.  I'm no code novelist but it's certainly fascinating (to me)  to see the output of what I write (or sometime copy and paste;).</p>
<p>Any visible finished products up online?  The code looks cryptic to me (pun intended).</p>

				<p>Hello Everyone, </p>
<p>  Its been awhile since my last field report, I seem to keep forgetting about writing my reports. It kind of gets lost in the shuffle of the assignments I get  from my organization. Anyway, I just recently attend the She's Geeky (un) conference in Mountian View, CA. The conference was  for women working in the field of technology. I got to meet a lot of people outside of the nonprofit tech world such as, google reps, yahoo reps, and AOL reps. It was awesome I even got free public speaking training from acting and speech prof. from UC Berkley. Its amazing how much I learned in 3hrs, needless to say this session was very effective. On another note life at Grassroots.org is pretty good, I will keep everyone updated.</p>

	    <p>Basically,If there is any papers stapled together you take the staples out.If any of the pieces of paper have any information on the back u have to make a copy of it. Then, You have to switch out some blue papers. The old blue papers had a number on it and the new blue papers have information in the middle of it. Then u have to scan those papers and when it is scanned, it is sent to the computer.Then, I have to check and make sure everything is scanned.</p>

				<p>Hi Everybody,</p>
<p>This is my first post since...well...my actual first post.  Lots has happened to me including a few trips and two moves.  I've marked a time to write my update on Google Calendar, so I'll make it a point to pump those reports out.</p>
<p>My work is going crazy.  I have the tasks that I'm assigned to including client intake for our programs and developing new content for our new site that will be coming out in the near future.  The thing I don't like are all of the loose threads of other ideas/projects that I've had to both take up and drop.  Recent developments, including my supervisor recently leaving, will definitely restructure my duties.  This situation reminds me of when I used to work at a restaurant.  There you had to know how to multitask and know your priorities.  Here, it's the same, but also different.</p>
<p>I'm still getting an idea about this organization and how it functions.  Being away from the center of Grassroots.org has definitely let me work more independently.  (It's definitely a testament to my work ethic.)  Unfortunately, it's also made me unsure about the specifications my coworkers accept out of me since a skype message or phone call is much different than an in-person check.  I have since learned to care less not about the quality of the work but about what other people think.</p>
<p>But, I'm finally getting settled in.  I have an office.  I'm getting business cards made as I write.  Most of my Americorps benefits are in order.  Things are going well, but I promise to go into more detail later.</p>
<p>Good to Be Back,<br />
Karl</p>

				<p>It's been awhile since I've posted, but I finally have motivation to do so: NeighborMedia participants are now banging out the media! Check it out at <a href="http://www.cctvcambridge.org/neighbormedia" title="www.cctvcambridge.org/neighbormedia">www.cctvcambridge.org/neighbormedia</a></p>
<p>Wondering why there are so many text-only blog entries and not as much video or audio or even images? Well, we're working on it. Most of our citizen journalists, though, are reporters first and media-makers second, and even if they get up to the phase of shooting video, it takes awhile for anyone to get familiar with digital editing enough to actually submit their finished products. In meeting with one of our citizen journalists, I showed her how to take pictures with her cell phone and even record audio with it, which will be great tools that will let her avoid having to take out a videocamera or one of our old-school still cameras every time she wants to get a little media other than text.</p>
<p>As far as the youth go..It finally occurred to me that the best tool for video distribution and outreach at Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School is...drumroll please....</p>
<p>Facebook! I was very excited when one of the students started a Facebook group, and then the lightbulb went off in my head that this is the way to get more people involved in the show. It's hard to imagine that any of them actually watch Cambridge Educational Access channels 98 and 99, so once we post the video online, we'll Facebook message all 40+ people in the Youth View Cambridge group with the link to the video on the CEA website.</p>
<p>For other Web 2.0 tools we're experimenting with for youth, check out a recent blog entry of mine at <a href="http://www.cctvcambridge.org/node/1923" title="http://www.cctvcambridge.org/node/1923">http://www.cctvcambridge.org/node/1923</a></p>
<p>Want to see the first episode of Youth View Cambridge when it goes up? Join the facebook group! No, students can't access social networking sites like Facebook from the HS or media arts studio. But, it's OK, 'cause we all know how much time they spend "facebooking" (myself included) from home.</p>

				<p>Well, tomorrow is the day we are handing out the first 30 of the 225 computers to 7th graders at Hairston Middle School.  I have recruited volunteers, made sure that the computers are ready and that all the students that are scheduled to come tomorrow, have turned in all the various forms that were required to be completed before they received  their computer.  So I guess I have prepared to the best of my ability, I still think it is going to be chaos though.  We are letting them come in and pick which computer they want so I can see fights breaking out in my head already.  But I am just going to go with the flow, I have learned that if you can effectively do this without getting frustrated the nonprofit world wont have such a negative affect on you.  We have to plan but I have seen plans go out the window several times.  It just the environment you are in and the population you are trying to serve, when so many people are trying to collaborate to reach one goal, miscommunication is almost guaranteed to happen. But like I said before, if you can go with the flow, you will be fine! I am still planning on putting together some info for you but I havent had much time, after the giveways are over, I think it can be done.   </p>
<p>Oh, I am also proud to say that over the past couple weeks I have developed partnership with 3 other nonprofit agencies: Greensboro Housing Authority and Women's Recourse Center and Women's Workforce Web.  Representatives from these agencies have decided to work with us in developing a grant that funds all of our services.  We are a unique org. so we can often form our mission to fit the interest of several different funders.  Like environmental, educational and other human services.  So to not over use our funders, these other agencies will seek the funding and we participate in the programs.  </p>
<p>For example, Women's Workforce Web has a 12 week program that prepares women for various working environments .  An incentive to finish the program could be that when they have completed all the requirements they receive a free computer from our org. So we can be a part of the grant, receive some funding as well and serve more people in the community without having to charge our low fee.  I think nonprofits should collaborate more with grants, seeking the funds together, but I know many smaller org, like ours have trouble with this because they are so short staffed or they need keep their focus on getting funds for the stability of the organization and can not look beyond their immediate needs.  Well I guess that is all for now..................................................</p>

	    <p>Awesome job getting your bases covered for the computer hand out! How'd it end up going? </p>
<p>You also definitely hit on something so key to smaller orgs and that's collaborating on mutually beneficial grants, especially as government funding drys up with a record number of non-profits in operation. How's the strategic planning going by the way?</p>
