<p> I just input my information. I&#39;m sitting here with all the other new VISTA&#39;s. </p>
<p> I think we should be VISTU&#39;s. </p>
<p>Volunteers in service of the united States. I have a pet peeve about refering to the USA as America. America is the continant. The United States of America is the Country.</p>
<p> Well, I will add a little more to this blog. I just learned about tagging. It seems pretty nifty. I&#39;m not really sure what to write about. so i think that&#39;s that for today.  </p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

				<p>Just testing the blog feature.  I&#39;m currently sitting at the PSO learning about the features on this website. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will be working at <a href="http://digitalartscorps.org/www.aspirationtech.org">Aspiration Tech</a> in San Francisco.  Up until now I have been working as an Engineer for <a href="http://digitalartscorps.org/www.jhuapl.edu">Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab</a> in Laurel, MD.  I worked in the Space Department designing and testing electrical equipment for spacecraft.  I worked on <a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/">MESSENGER</a> and most recently on <a href="http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/">STEREO</a> (which will launch one of these days, not that I'm bitter or anything).  </p>
<p>I went to <a href="http://digitalartscorps.org/www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a> where I earned a BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a double-major in Mathematics.</p>
<p>I'm really looking forward to my year at Aspiration, and to making more posts that will hopefully have some more interesting content than this one. :-)</p>

<p><strong>These volunteers work to cultivate:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>the program capacity of each local organization and,</strong></li>
<li><strong>a meaningful collaborative network among non-profit with related goals for social change.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Project sustains and expands this network using new media and technology tools and practices, while encouraging the free exchange of ideas and resources.  </strong></p>

				<p><em>Thanks to a great fellow VISTA Leader I met at VISTA Leader training last week in DC, Carly from <a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/macc/" target="_blank">Tufts University Campus Compact,</a> I&#39;ve got a little tongue and cheek version of how to live on the VISTA budget that former VISTA Leaders, Ira Hammerslough and Marc Velasquez,</em><em> created.  It&#39;s very Boston centric, but it does have a lot of general informative stuff.</em></p>
<p><strong>Surviving on a VISTA Budget</strong></p>
<p>The following is a short list of money-saving techniques your VISTA* predecessors have compiled for your fiscal pleasure. A lot of this is common sense, and some of it is comfort level. (The authors disavow themselves of any responsibility for legal ramifications and personal offense of following the advice contained herein.)</p>
<p><strong>Sustenance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Live and play in cheaper areas.  Immerse yourself in your community and bid your time with people of similar financial means- living within your budget will come naturally this way.</li>
<li>Food Stamps:  mass.gov.  Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance.  Project Bread- projectbread.org.  This will qualify you for Reduced Rate Utilities.  Action for Boston Community Development (ABCD) will walk you through the application process.  Assets count, your household is who you prepare your meals with- doesn&#39;t have to include your roommates.</li>
<li>Costco, BJ&#39;s, Sam&#39;s, Big Lots</li>
<li>Farmer&#39;s Markets: Haymarket, weekends, Davis Square Wed, Union Square sat</li>
<li>Eat in!</li>
<li>When you go out, take half your meal for lunch the next day.</li>
<li>Tupperware- raid buffets, any and all catered functions</li>
<li>Co-ops.  servenewengland.com  2 hours a month community service gets you a membership</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Health and Well-being</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>YMCA</li>
<li>Walk/Bike/Run/Rollerblade/Skateboard whenever possible- avoid the gym!</li>
<li>Dental Student Clinics, Gentle Dental</li>
<li>Cut your own hair- it&#39;s cheap and often hilarious.  Think Barber shop, not salon. </li>
<li>If you aren&#39;t given free access to your org’s gym, ask about free/reduced rates.  Never underestimate the kindness of others.</li>
<li>Visit you local hospital&#39;s community development office, free yoga etc.</li>
<li>Take full advantage of your health care.  If you want a physical, which isn&#39;t covered, just go to the doctor complaining of an ambiguous, non pre-existing ailment.  The first thing they&#39;ll do is give you a complete physical.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Entertainment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use you semi-student status to its full advantage.  Look for student coupon and discount books.</li>
<li>Volunteer and go for free.  Yoga, blue man group, Club Passim (Cambridge)</li>
<li>Free concerts and movies.  Hatch shell and harbor, Copley.</li>
<li>Library.  local, Boston, and campus</li>
<li>Discount Days. college day at museums.</li>
<li>Free Food.  Grendels Den Pizzeria Uno, Pour house.  Johnny D&#39;s monday night trivia has free pizza.</li>
<li>Shopping.  Getsugar.com</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nightlife</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Happy Hours.</li>
<li>If you smoke, quit.  If you drink, quit that too :)</li>
<li>Cover charges.  Are a bad idea even if you are rich, let alone if you make $11,000.</li>
<li>Spend time in your local watering holes- cheap pints and no pretension!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Life After VISTA*</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CNCS Resource Center. access or make friends</li>
<li>Kaplan</li>
<li>Fee Waivers</li>
<li>Networking.  Is a dirty word, but it&#39;s how you get jobs.</li>
<li>MeetAmericorps.com or VISTAOlinc.net</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Frugality Tips</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Turn in-kind into kind.</li>
<li><a href="http://ctcvista.org/node/1243">Make a budget</a>, incoming outgoing, notice where you spend.</li>
<li>Save.  If you can. if you have money now put some away so you&#39;re not hanging.  Remember, most of you will not be able to save on the stipend.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t spend money you don&#39;t have- be wary of credit.</li>
<li>Your public transportation pass allows you to bring a friend for free on Sundays.</li>
<li>Coupons and Rewards Cards: Drug and grocery stores like CVS and Stop and Shop</li>
<li>One person&#39;s treasure...You&#39;ll be amazed at what people with too much money will discard.  Go to Allston/Brighton on August 31st and furnish you place. Or check out the Garmet District near MIT for clothes.</li>
<li>Save your empty cans and bottles for the deposit.  You&#39;ve already paid for them.</li>
<li>Wireless Networks.  &quot;Borrow&quot; some time on the internet in your neighborhood, find cafés with free wireless (Panera) or use access at work.</li>
<li>Tipping.  Is important, but remember you wallet probably isn&#39;t what it used to be.  Politeness, patience, and a modest tip go a long way.</li>
<li>Acknowledge your weakness.  Everyone has an Achilles heel when it comes to spending.  Acknowledge it, indulge it, but don&#39;t go crazy.</li>
</ul>

On subsequent pages are several methods and approaches for planning and getting started with your DAY program, including project-based learning, portfolios, after school and in-school activities. Also, creating the space (DAY studio) is important, as well as developing the actual activities for your program. Upon request are some great lessons for teaching digital art (on CD).</p>
<p><strong>Digital Art   Youth Program (DAY) </strong></p>
<p>In 2000, three community-based technology centers across the country launched &quot;ArtTech&quot;, a five-week summer program that introduced youth to multimedia. Soon after the project was renamed the <a href="http://dayprogram.net/">Digital     Art Youth Program</a> or DAY. <a href="mailto:nettrice@gmail.com">Nettrice Gaskins</a> created a resource guide for practitioners that was made available upon request. She also ran a local DAY program at the Boston Neighborhood Network from 2001-2004, with the help of an AmeriCorps VISTA (Derek Hixon). The Boston program served nearly a hundred local youth between the ages of 13 and 18. Additionally, Nettrice worked with a public high school in Dorchester to create school-based curriculum for teachers and students. </p>
<p>Creating the DAY resource guide has been a labor of love for Nettrice (she did not profit from it). For more information about the guide visit the <a href="http://dayprogram.net/">DAY     web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Computer Animation </strong></p>
<p>In 2005, Nettrice taught three computer animation classes at the Massachusetts College of Art. Two of the classes were for 12-18 year olds and the other was for high school students. For these classes Nettrice developed a <a href="http://babel.massart.edu/%7Enettrice/">web     site</a> and <a href="http://babel.massart.edu/%7Enettrice/stuff_page.html">curriculum</a>. The activities   culminated in a CD/DVD and screening of youth work.   The work can also be seen on the web here: <a href="http://portal.nettrice.us/bm/">Digital     Media Channel</a>. </p>

				<p>Experience has proven that it&#39;s important to introduce people to the process of making digital media, not just how to use the tools and applications. Digital art and media making addresses both visual and media literacy, as well as using software, computer technology, and digital equipment. As a member of the CTC VISTA Project focus area, there are many ways to communicate, share, explore and brainstorm ideas, including the new priority area <a href="http://localhost/Users/shannon/Library/Mail/IMAP-shannon.mccue@imap.umb.edu/INBOX.imapmbox/new_resource_pages.mimeattach/digitalmedia.html#">portal</a>, Nettrice&#39;s <a href="http://mixxnmash.blogspot.com/">Mixx &amp;      Mash Blog</a>, the Project&#39;s online discussions, and, of course, a mailing list/listserv provided by CTC VISTA (for VISTA workers and supervisors).</p>
<p>In August 2005, VISTAs attended an overview of the digital media for youth priority area, led by Nettrice R. Gaskins, as part of the CTC VISTA Project pre-service orientation. Attendees received a handout during the session. The materials introduced digital media and youth development, including examples of <a href="http://babel.massart.edu/%7Enettrice/">computer      animation</a> from the Youth at Art Tech summer class at the Mass College of Art. This class was also taught by Nettrice. Video of this presentation is available on the CTC VISTA <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/video/digital_media_for_youth.html">website</a>. Nettrice R. Gaskins is an adjunct faculty and computer arts academic specialist at UMass/Boston and Mass College of Art, as well as a board member of CTCNet and NAMAC<span>. Nettrice has been doing computer animation since high school in Kentucky. Back then she was using Macintosh and Amiga computers. When she graduated from high school, she got a full art scholarship to attend Pratt Institute in New York City and another full scholarship to attend the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She majored in computer graphics at Pratt and art &amp; technology at SAIC. Today, Nettrice wears a lot of hats. She has been teaching and working with youth for 14 years. Nettrice&#39;s online portfolio is <a href="http://www.nettrice.us/">NetArt</a>.</span></p>
<p>Nettrice was a CTC VISTA Project supervisor at the BNN Multimedia Center, from 2003-2004. She worked with Derek P. Hixon, a former VISTA, and ran digital art/media classes for Boston-area youth. She also served as the original CTC VISTA Project priority area coordinator from 2005-2006.</p>

				<p>From <a href="http://members.dca.net/areid/proposal.htm">A PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR WRITING PROPOSALS</a>: </p>
<p>Any proposal offers a plan to fill a need, and your   reader will evaluate your plan according to how well   your written presentation answers questions about WHAT   you are proposing, HOW you plan to do it, WHEN you plan   to do it, and HOW MUCH it is going to cost. To do this   you must ascertain the level of knowledge that your audience   possesses and take the positions of all your readers   into account. You must also discern whether your readers   will be members of your technical community, of your   technical discourse community, or of both, and then use   the appropriate materials and language to appeal to both.   You might provide, for those outside of your specific   area of expertise, an executive summary written in non-technical   (easily accessible) language, or you might include a   glossary of terms that explains technical language used   in the body of the proposal, and/ or attach appendices   that explain technical information in generally understood   language.</p>
<p></p>
<p> Proposals are informative and persuasive writing because  they attempt to educate the reader and to convince that   reader to do something. The goal of the writer is not   only to persuade the reader to do what is being requested,   but also to make the reader believe that the solution   is practical and appropriate. In persuasive proposal   writing, the case is built by the demonstration of logic   and reason in the approach taken in the solution.</p>

				<p><img src="http://digitalartscorps.org/files/user4/1pic2.jpg" alt="youth on computers" title="youth on computers" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="134" height="91" align="right" />Through Networks for Youth Development   the <a href="http://www.fcny.org/portal.php/syd/">Fund     for the City of New York</a> developed a handbook   of &quot;positive youth outcomes&quot; for practitioners. Youth   development programs help youth develop competencies   that will enable them to grow, develop skills, and   become healthy, responsible, and caring people. Youth   development is a shared responsibility, practioners   cannot do it alone. They need the buy-in of youth,   their families and community partners because many   factors affect young people&#39;s lives. Networks for Youth   Development has combined research, discussion, and   practical experience in articulating best practices   of youth development. They have identified the following   competencies for positive youth outcomes:
</p><p><strong>O</strong>riginality (Creative Competency)</p>
<p><strong>U</strong>nderstanding ourselves and others (Personal competency)</p>
<p><strong>T</strong>hinking and reasoning (Cognitive competency)</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>ivic competency</p>
<p><strong>O</strong>ur bodies   (Physical health competency)</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>ental health competency</p>
<p><strong>E</strong>mployability competency</p>
<p><strong>S</strong>ocial competency</p>
<p>All young people will not demonstrate   these competencies in the same way. These are progressive   competencies that young people will develop at different   rates. Obviously, young people can obtain these competencies   in many ways but for the purposes of this site we will   focus on the use of digital media to achieve various   outcomes. </p>
<p><strong>Positive Youth Outcomes with   Digital Media </strong></p>
<p>Creative competency applies to the exploration   and development of self-expression. Digital media-related   activities provide youth with opportunities for artistic   expression, to express individuality, etc. Achievement   outcomes include developing or publishing portfolios. </p>
<p>Personal   competency applies to actions that reflect the understanding   of one&#39;s own opinions and thoughts and those of others   in order to handle situations appropriately and non-violently.   For many people the Internet and World Wide Web has   opened up whole new worlds. Young people are using   chat rooms, discussion forums, weblogs, and   web sites to connect to articulate and listen to others,   recognize and relate to themselves and others, and   define and analyze issues. Achievement outcomes include   securing adequate living arrangements, having safe   environments, managing money, and daily living routines. </p>
<p>Cognitive competency applies to intellectual   development and the integration of information into   operational functions. This is where educational activities   play an important role. Tutorial programs help young   people become more aware of their learning process   and develop analytical and organizational thinking.   They are able to set goals and develop basic skills.   Achievement outcomes include getting a high school   diploma or GED, or mastery of English language. Regarding   digital media, this area is wide open for exploration. </p>
<p>Civic competency applies to a core of   respect and value for civil and human rights of oneself   and others and the recognition that one can further   these rights for oneself and one&#39;s community by participating   in the governmental process and in community service   and  organization. Digital media can be a tool for   developing this competency in a variety of ways. Achievement   outcomes include creating Public Service Announcements   and slide shows, publishing web sites and brochures.</p>
<p>Physical health competency applies to   the ability to maintain one&#39;s well-being and to identify,   understand, and practice healthy behaviors. Achievement   outcomes include creating PSAs and  web sites   with information regarding regular   physical examinations health maintenance. </p>
<p>Mental health competency applies to the   ability to identify, understand and deal with one&#39;s   emotions and feelings.</p>
<p>Employability competency applies to vocational   awareness based upon analysis of the current labor   market and work-place conditions; they are not perscriptive   judgments. The loss of U.S. jobs to overseas competitors   is shaping up to be one of the defining issues of the   new century. People are seeing   not just a decline in manufacturing jobs, but also   the outsourcing of hundreds of thousands of digital   media-related jobs--everything from software coders   to video editors. </p>
<p>&quot;Other countries are   now encroaching more directly and successfully on what   has been, for almost two decades, the heartland of   our economic success -- the creative economy. Better   than any other country in recent years, America has   developed new technologies and ideas that spawn new   industries and modernize old ones, from the Internet   to big-box stores to innovative product designs. And   these have proved the principal force behind the U.S.   economy&#39;s creation of more than 20 million jobs in   the creative sector during the 1990s, even as it continued   to shed manufacturing, agricultural, and other jobs.&quot;   - From <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0401.florida.html">Creative Class War by Richard Florida</a> </p>
<p>Achievement outcomes for employability   include  jobs and mentoring for youth through workforce   development (partnerships), job certification and training,   GED and high school diploma, and job retention.</p>
<p>Social competency applies to the manner   in which one consistently responds to other individuals,   expects other individuals to respond to oneself and   interaction with members of groups sharing one&#39;s &quot;social   address&quot; as well as with members of groups different   than one&#39;s own. Achievement outcomes include the ability   to form and maintain consistent relationships, i.e.   through conferences, youth festivals, and screenings. </p>
<p><strong>Myth of the   Digital Generation</strong></p>
<p> This refers to the idea   that growing up online is going to produce a more socially   connected, better informed, and more creative generation.   In a way, having access to online, digital media content   can increase awareness and knowledge of the world.   In another way, this myth can distort the reality kids   must negotiate in the online world, and exaggerate   the centrality of digital media in children&#39;s lives.</p>
<p>Studies show that young people are using   the Internet effectively as a resource for doing homework,   connecting with friends, and seeking out news and entertainment.   This does not mean they are more media literate or   more able to succeed in school. Young people should   have a menu of educational activities both online and   offline. Media education should be a part of their   education, in order to be better informed about digital   media.</p>

Well, a group of VISTA Leaders pondered this question at this fall&#39;s training and determined that it&#39;s actually very valuable to have a few good jokes up your sleeve.  For instance, if one of fellow VISTAs/co-workers is having a bad day, a good joke never hurt.  On a more professional note, several VISTAs cited job interviews that he/she was asked to tell a joke, probably to test their ability to react quickly and have a sense of humor.</p>
<p>So here&#39;s just a sample of some jokes from VISTA leaders to get you started (I have to admit they&#39;re not the best I ever heard, but they&#39;re a start:</p>
<p>Where do the general keep their armies?</p>
<p><em>In their &quot;sleevies&quot;</em></p>
<p>Two peanuts walkin&#39; down the street</p>
<p>...<em>one was assaulted/a salted</em>.</p>
<p>Heard of that new pirate movie?</p>
<p><em>It&#39;s rated aaarrrrggh. </em></p>
<p>Duck walks into a bar. </p>
<p><em>Then he said &quot;ouch.&quot;</em></p>
<p>What did the dragon say when she came upon a row of knights?</p>
<p><em>&quot;ugh. More canned food.&quot;</em></p>
<p>What do you call a dead baby in a blender?</p>
<p><em>Salsa</em></p>
<p>So a blonde was looking for some extra cash.  She started walking around her neighborhood asking neighbors if they had any odd jobs she could do for them.  The guy next door suggests that she paint his porch for $50 bucks.  She agrees happily and goes off to get supplies.  The guy goes in and brags to this wife that he just fooled a blonde into painting their huge wrap-around porch for a mere 50 bucks.  About 20 minutes later, the blonde rings the doorbell and says she&#39;s done.  The guy says &quot;Wow, that was really fast.&quot;  The blonde responds, &quot;It was pretty easy.  Oh and by the way, it&#39;s not a porch, it&#39;s a Ferrari.&quot;</p>
<p>So an economist, physicist, and a chemist get stranded on a desert island.  There&#39;s no coconuts so they start getting pretty hungry.  All of a sudden, a big ol&#39; can of beans washes up on the shore.  They get excited but then they realize they have no way to get it open easily.  The physicist suggest they drop the can from the ocean cliff and the free fall will open the can.  Then they realize that wouldn&#39;t work because then the beans would be strewn all over the rocks below.  Then the chemist suggests that they put the can in a fire to increase the internal heat of the can until it pops open.  But they realize that would just make the beans explode.  Finally the economist  says &quot;What if we just had a can opener?&quot;</p>

<p>The other three days a week, I&#39;ll be serving with <a href="http://www.massimpact.org" target="_blank" title="massIMPACT">massIMPACT</a>, a non-profit housed in MassHousing on Beacon Street downtown, where I&#39;ll be managing a new web portal project for digital storytelling facilitators (<a href="http://storiesforchange.net/" target="_blank" title="Stories For Change">http://storiesforchange.net/)</a> and supporting the <a href="http://www.massimpact.org/projects/digital_storytelling/index.shtml" target="_blank">training</a> of more community based facilitators.  I&#39;m also hoping to get out to the community more and do some more work actually with folks in community technology &amp; media centers.  </p>
<p>Sound busy enough? </p>
<p>Oh and why the monkey? Well, in the strange congruence of my month of August, I attended both a laid back gathering of digital storytelling facilitators in beautiful Ukiah, CA and a federally rigid Americorps leadership training in DC.  But no matter how different each sounds from each other, they both contained self reflection and introduction into new buzz word lexicons.  So when Paul told me to &quot;find my power animal&quot;, I stumbled upon it at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park at an exhibit called <a href="http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/ThinkTank/" target="_blank">Think Tank</a>.  Basically, it detailed how we define &quot;thinking&quot; and explored whether animals other than humans meet the criteria.  So the lesson learned...if a monkey can think intelligently, then it should be easier for humans (especially those who work on community technology &amp; media) to do the same.   </p>

			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p>This morning a co-worker placed an article from the July 2006 edition of Communications Engineering and Design Magazine entitled <a href="http://www.cedmagazine.com/article/CA6348436.html">"Net neutrality legislation--my take on it"</a> by Jeffrey Krauss, President of Telecommunications and Technology Policy.</p>
<p>Net Neutrality is an important issue; pending legislation and changing business practices have the potential to dramatically change how we use the Internet. Below I have responded to some of the points Mr. Krauss brought up in the article.</p>
<p>
<em>"There's an enormous coalition supporting net neutrality, hundreds of individuals and organizations and companies that I have never heard of. But if you follow the money, you find that it's really Google, Amazon.com, eBay and Yahoo! that are behind this campaign."</em></p>
<p>Yes, there is wide support for Net Neutrality and for good reason. I run several small websites (and am known to browse the web myself), and am happy that Google, Amazon.com, et al are behind the campaign and helping to pay for it. I don't have the money or resources to fight for Net Neutrality as well as they can, so I'm really glad that<br />
they are.</p>
<p><em>"Never mind that was no evidence that any ISP was blocking access"</em></p>
<p>A Canadian Telco has <a href="http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/Canada/2005/07/24/1145417-sun.html">blocked access</a>. AT&amp;T's CEO is <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/3ced445e-91c5-11da-bab9-0000779e2340.html">threatening to do so </a>.</p>
<p><em>"What? You say that your voice telephone service, which uses the PacketCable specifications designed by CableLabs, gives better quality of service control than the versions offered by Skype or Vonage? That's prohibited. Too bad!"</em></p>
<p>Exactly. As a paying customer I should be able to use whatever service I want as long as it is not malicious to the network itself. There is a big difference between "malicious" and merely "inefficient".</p>
<p>The main issue is the structural difference between content or services (Amazon, Google, Skype, P2P), and distribution (ISPs and bandwidth). This is not entirely cut and dry because Telcos are ISPs and offer services (Comcast VOIP), and Google may soon become an ISP, but the concept that the content or services themselves, and their distribution should be seperate is at the heart of the Net Neutrality debate.</p>
<p><em>"But they don't give you the right to use network intelligence to block spam, or to identify and control peer-to-peer traffic."</em></p>
<p>What is wrong with peer-to-peer traffic? The issue should be the content itself, if it's copyrighted material, not the manner in which it's distributed (P2P as opposed to Server-Client), and there are many legal uses of P2P (such as noncommecial media and Open Source Software distribution). Like I said earlier, as a customer, I pay for bandwidth (as does Google, et al), and I believe I should have the right to use that bandwidth in any fashion I choose, as long as it is not malicious to the network. If the issue is that the ISP has oversold their bandwidth with the assumption that I *wouldn't* use it, then that is the ISP's failure--and one that proper market forces will take care of.</p>
<p><em>"There are already commercial mechanisms that allow Web vendors to achieve improved quality of service, but these bills would prohibit ISPs from offering such services."</em></p>
<p>There are commercial mechanisms, like the Akamai example given in the text, that Amazon and other web vendors use to increase network speed and efficiency. But these occur upstream of ISPs; an ISP could then QoS out any benefit from using Akamai on the ISP's network. Without Net Neutrality legislation, in order for Amazon to offer a guaranteed user experience, they would have to contract with the ISP of every single customer Amazon wishes to do business with. This would actually drive services like Akamai out of business! And if I don't have the money or resources to negotiate with ISPs, then I'm locked out; a little guy.</p>
<p><em>"Nothing in these bills protects ISPs from powerful content owners imposing their priorities unilaterally."</em></p>
<p>Why would these bills include that? That isn't even technologically possible. Google itself has no power over me if I choose instead to use Yahoo (or any competing search engine, large or small) in my web browser. Unfortunately, my ISP *does* have the power to unilaterally affect what search engine I use, and Net Neutrality legislation hopes to make it illegal for my ISP to brandish that power. Google and Yahoo provide content, ISPs should distribute that content without regard to who it is coming from.</p>
<p><em>"If new technology or new services were to be deployed that allow competitors to leapfrog their dominant market position, that's bad for them. The goal of this legislation is to make sure that doesn't happen."</em></p>
<p>Completely false. The concept of Net Neutrality is that any content or service can compete on equal footing without the express consent (or money changing hands) of the distributors. In fact, this statement is directly applicable to the ISPs desires, *not* the services. In the earlier example of the VOIP service, ISPs want to slow or block deployment of Skype or Vonage because they *do* in fact "compete" with services offered natively by ISPs.</p>
<p>Companies like Amazon, Google and Yahoo are owed their enormous growth and success because they have offered superior services that have competed fairly without ISPs meddling. These companies continue to innovate because they currently *do not* lock out (or slow down) competitors (both current and emerging) by contracting with ISPs for special status or enhanced benefits; Net Neutrality legislation seeks to codify this. Google was once a small business that succeeded through innovation; without Net Neutrality, other innovative small businesses will not have the chance to share in similar success.</p>

	    <p>Wow, that sounds unbelievably complicated. My understanding was this: if those that want net Neutrality get their way then the internet will have two tiers. One you will have to pay lots of money to use, which is where all the useful web content will end up. The other tier will be for poor folk and won&#39;t have any thing.
</p><p>    Is this a correct summation? Do I have it backwards?</p>
<p>    Also. Would it be possible for us to communicate directly with other CTCVISTA&#39;s here. i.e. and email feature. i know you don&#39;t want this to get too much like myspace, but it would be convienant to be able to communicate one on one with each other on this site.</p>

	    <p>yeah, you&#39;ve got net neutrality backwards: net neutrality means that nothing on the net should have priority; ie, there shouldn&#39;t be tiered internet access and networks should treat all data the same, not seperating it into google&#39;s data, aol&#39;s data, and your data.</p>
