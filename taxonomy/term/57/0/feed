 <description>&lt;p&gt;Boston ROCKS!  Well, Lowell anyways.  I haven&#039;t seen any of Boston except from the interstate.  But Lowell?  Well, last night we crashed the Brewery Exchange.  Fun times.  Tomorrow night we&#039;ll go back for Bull Riding.  Tonight we&#039;re hoping for karaoke, pool and drunken darts at the PITA bartender.  Savage, I know, but this is Boston and apparently all bartenders are required to be rude here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I woke on the 16th floor to a squeaky bed and bright lights, feeling the burn for my two greatest needs:  caffeine &amp;amp; nicotine.  I thought briefly of stealing my roommate&#039;s lighter, but he&#039;s a black man from D.C. and I had no interest in finding out what sort of retribution he might deliver for such an affront.  Instead I went wandering through the streets.  At 7 am.  For a lighter and coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this girl beside me thinks she looks like a monkey without shaving her legs.  I&#039;m not sure how to tell her that&#039;s ridiculous, but I suppose this&#039;ll work.  She looks nothing like a monkey.  A lizard, perhaps....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heh.  Gonzo journalism at it&#039;s finest.  Hunter, eatcher heart out.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>This girl has landed!</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/412</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I flew to Oakland from the Boston PSO at 10:30 pm (I&amp;#39;m a Philly girl so that is 1:30 am my time) and was so tired yet filled with excitement. I can&amp;#39;t believe my cat and I made it in one piece! My supervisor from OTX-West (Oakland Technology Exchange) picked me up from the airport. I was missing one of my bags thanks to Delta but that didn&amp;#39;t bother me because I was in Cali! My supervisor took me to my co-workers house in Alameda where I would be staying until I find a place. Him and his wife are really cool folks. They&amp;#39;ve never met me but they offered their home to me. We sat back and talked, ate expensive cheese and drank some wine (now that&amp;#39;s my kind of greeting). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning, I went with my co-working to OTX-West to get a tour of the site and sit in on the computer literacy class that he was teaching. This place is awesome! They have done so much already to help bridge the digital divide in Oakland. I&amp;#39;m really glad I&amp;#39;m a part of their team  I checked out my desk and it is cool. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever had a desk before so I&amp;quot;m excited to have one. I can&amp;#39;t wait to start on Monday! , I look forward to my year of service and helping OTX-West better server the people of Oakland. Later....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Naomi&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>From LA&gt; Boston</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/406</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I arrived in Boston for the first time in life last night to a scary 15 degree climate. Cold to many, but from someone raised in LA an experienced 80 degrees on Christmas, this was just flippin ridiculous.-lol You know how your foot tingles when it falls asleep, yeah that&amp;#39;s how my whole face felt. I missed my first plane @ 620am from LAX to Salt Lake city but was on my on the 8ish am flight with a lay-over in ATL. Goodness gracious why couldn&amp;#39;t I have gone to the pso in Atlanta, would&amp;#39;ve cut the flight in half. Anywho, I&amp;#39;m havin a ball out here in Boston where the accent is apparent. So many green trees and fresh water is foreign to me. It&amp;#39;s like a new concept when you&amp;#39;re accustomed to a smog filled road-raged infested city. I have like 1 of the coolest supervisors ever (Martin Cheesebouroh) of The Media Aid Center. Basically we give inner-city High School kids the opportunity to learn and get inolved with the film and media industry. We teach various software &amp;amp; build sound stages &amp;amp; TV studios in schools. In 07 I&amp;#39;m plotting world domination! I&amp;#39;m still at the pso so I&amp;#39;ve gotta be brief. Who&amp;#39;ve thought I be so darn chatty with my very first Blog entry ever?? Not Mike, no sir. Gotta run. Ya&amp;#39;ll stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Big Mike &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>PSO in Boston</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/400</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Two day PSOs are not so much like month long PSOs like NCCC has conditioned me for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It lacks Red Cross Classes and creepy looking mannequins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no driver training and pretending you can remember everything about a twelve passenger van for when you become the vehicle specialist eight months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no uniforms so there&amp;#39;s confusion in the morning when suddenly you don&amp;#39;t have to wear BDUs and make bigger decisions than &amp;quot;Should I wear my long sleeved or short sleeved grey shirt?&amp;quot; or  &amp;quot;Do you think I should wear the fleece vest?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still people that tell you where to go and what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You still stay in hotel rooms, but not because you&amp;#39;re on spike travel from New Orleans back to Denver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a little background on myself: I&amp;#39;m a 19 (almost 20) year old from Ohio...or anywhere. Since I graduated highschool in 2005, I&amp;#39;ve been travelling with Americorps*NCCC. I almost went back as a second-year corpsmember so I could be on a sweet team with someone from my original team being my TL, but I decided against it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; NCCC, for me, consisted of gutting houses all day (taking anything and everything out of a house like mud, carpet, toys, dry wall, furniture, sinks, mirrors, and windows...not in the order), everyday; canoeing with alligators in Louisiana&amp;#39;s swamps and bayous; attending high school football games in the Chicksaw capitol, and freezing on the weekends while hiking around the streets of Denver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduation, I deliberated for a couple of weeks in Ohio about what I should do exactly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VISTA and I had this long conversation about why I should join it and why it would be good for me.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>From East to West...</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/396</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! My name is Naomi and I&amp;#39;m from Philly. I headed to Oakland and I&amp;#39;m really excited to be serving in the beautiful state of California. It&amp;#39;s a big move for me since I&amp;#39;ve never lived anywhere else. If I end up loving California (which I know I will), I will stay after my year is over.  Well, I guess I will keep everyone posted on how things go. See ya!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Still Waiting...</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/209</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I am blogging about my frustration over Andrea (or Andie as she loves to be called) not finishing her roll of film from Boston. She has all of these awesome pictures of Goof Troop goofiness and they&amp;#39;re suspended in a disposable Kodak :(. They should definitely be on Flickr. So Andie, please finish the roll - take some pictures of Matt! So far he&amp;#39;s like your snuffalufugus (sp?). I mean, how do we &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; know he exists? This is the scientific age, we need proof. Anyone who feels the same, comment so she feels extra guilty :) Love you Andie!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>PSO Photos</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/172</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning VISTAs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have finally found a website that fits my needs for posting pictures.  I liked flickr overall, but didn&amp;#39;t like how there was a limit to how many pictures you could post since I wanted to use it for a number of pictures.  The site I found, Picasa, through Google, is exactly what I was looking for.  Although there is a limit, it&amp;#39;s more than I think I could ever use, at least for the time being.  Anyway, I just thought I&amp;#39;d share my photos from PSO in lovely Boston!  Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.com/LauraEHanley/BostonVISTAPSO?authkey=aq0bkXY2qrJqC30Dw8gWhhG-nuU&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;View pictures here!&quot;&gt;http://picasaweb.google.com/LauraEHanley/BostonVISTAPSO?authkey=aq0bkXY2qrJqC30Dw8gWhhG-nuU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In service,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>First Entry... EVER</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/69</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first official blog that I have ever written, very exciting. I&amp;#39;ve been here in Boston for nearly 24 hours (another first) for the Pre-Service Orientation. It&amp;#39;s been great-- great cruisin&amp;#39;, great people, great sight seeing (following the Red Line, you know who you are) and, of course, great blogging. When I leave here tomorrow I will return to San Diego, CA where I was born and raised and will also be serving, although an hour or so away from home. Laura Hanley and I will be living and serving together at a non-profit called Pangea Foundation. The specifics of our duties are still under construction but I&amp;#39;m definitely excited for the possibilities! I&amp;#39;m looking forward to meeting other Vistas in the area and maybe even doing some &amp;quot;social networking&amp;quot; which has gotten a lot of discussion time at the PSO. All in all, PSO has been awesome, and I think this year will be a great adventure :) &lt;/p&gt;
