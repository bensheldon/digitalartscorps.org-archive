 <title>Nearing the end of week one</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Nearing the end of week one......dang. Is anyone else feeling overwhelmed and like their brain is fried?  So much information and trying to process it all is taking its toll.  Hope everyone is enjoying themselves and finding out that their position is everything they hoped it would be.  I am enjoying myself and getting more and more excited about all of the things that need to be accomplished.  But its a slow start. Off for now.&lt;/p&gt;
