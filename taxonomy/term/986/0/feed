 <title>they play the banjo in my office</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Time goes by so quickly here in the mountains, but maybe that&#039;s because I&#039;ve spent a good portion of the past month away from Whitesburg. I was in Oakland, CA, for a week for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.criticalresistance.org&quot; title=&quot;CR10&quot;&gt;Critical Resistance 10th Anniversary Conference&lt;/a&gt;. It was a great week of meeting people, and learning about other organizations and resources. And I got to lead a workshop. First I had volunteers from the workshop session read the Thousand Kites Play aloud.  In this informal staged reading, a diverse group of voices were heard and a variety of experiences with the criminal justice system were expressed. Act 2 of the play is the audience&#039;s chance to tell their story. We heard from a man who was formerly incarcerated, a woman who&#039;s boyfriend is currently incarcerated, among others. It was a great conversation and I think that people walked away with some actions steps. Next time I do the presentation there are things I would like to do differently, but for a first go around, I think it went alright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also went to a session that was a planning group for a national coalition for prison arts work. I joined the technology team (so as to use all my new ctc skills!) and have created the &lt;a href=&quot;http://theprisonartscoalition.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; for the group.This isn&#039;t technically part of my job, but my organization is part of the coalition, and it&#039;s something that&#039;s important to me, so I&#039;m excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thirdcoastfestival.org/&quot;&gt;Third Coast International Audio Festival&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago and learned so much about radio! As I am a weekly radio producer, it seemed like a good festival for me to go to.  Many big NPR personalities were there, and I learned a lot about radio documentary, and also about using social media to promote the work. It was a cool conference, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past month we also finished up the facilitation guide &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.thousandkites.org/storage/appalshop/documents/thousandkitesfacilitationguide.pdf&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; (attached) and have revamped the website.  So now I&#039;m finally able to really start in on our StoryLine project, which will use a digital google map as the key element. Right now I&#039;m working on getting audio files into the website, and doing outreach to get more people to share their stories.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And next week I&#039;m starting a creative writing workshop in the nearby women&#039;s prison. I&#039;m hoping that eventually I&#039;ll be able to turn it into a digital storytelling workshop and since they have computers there it might be possible.  That&#039;s not work related. It&#039;s just fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So needless to say, I&#039;m busy down here. But the weather is still good, and I&#039;m still getting some good hiking in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, I hear the banjo almost daily in my office. What would a good appalachian office be without a banjo?&lt;/p&gt;
