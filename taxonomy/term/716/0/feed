 <description>&lt;p&gt;hey everyone, its been a while. I think i start every blog with &quot;its been a while since i wrote a blog&quot; haha. well i&#039;m a busy man. It&#039;s not easy working full time, making such a large sum of money and trying to find places to spend it all. HEY i think the greatest thing i did this year was go to the Sundance film festival. i met a funder from Adobe and spoke to him, showed him some stuff from Reel Works. a couple of months later he invited us to apply for a fifty thousand dollar grant. i&#039;m still crossing my fingers. we should hear the news this month. another cool thing i&#039;ve been doing is helping kids make movies. I&#039;ve helped produced about twenty short films this year. I think. Well some are still in the works. regardless show us some love at listenup.org. A few of our films are in a contest for cool prizes, including mine. please write a review and rate our movies. (especially mine) it would be much apreciated. here&#039;s the link. Mine is called &quot;The Beginning&quot; i wrote and shot it, in one day. its cool i guess.&lt;/p&gt;
