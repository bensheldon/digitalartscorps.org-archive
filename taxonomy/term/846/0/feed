 <title>Beat</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1083</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well it&#039;s been awhile since I&#039;ve posted, and I know I could just copy and paste from my CCTV blog, which I&#039;ll do eventually (once I get back to writing longer blog posts instead of just the snippets I&#039;ve had time to do lately). For now I must say: I am beat. I&#039;ve never worked so many days in a row in my life, and it&#039;s all because I just held the orientation (Saturday, 9/8) and first training session (Sunday, 9/9) for citizen journalists for our new program, NeighborMedia. It went well, but I&#039;m at the point of expiration.   I will probably advantage of the Jewish New Year tomorrow to rest and restore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re starting to launch CEA programs too (the youth newscast component of my VISTAness), which is something I&#039;ve been putting on the back burner that I really need to start focusing on. Thankfully there are some other staff members working on those projects with me, so I&#039;m not alone in that endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&#039;m thinking about posting some of my orientation materials on the wiki but I don&#039;t know how useful it would be to anyone else. I&#039;d like to attach the file here but that&#039;s not working either (help?), so you can just check it out in my blog at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cctvcambridge.org/node/1814&quot; title=&quot;http://www.cctvcambridge.org/node/1814&quot;&gt;http://www.cctvcambridge.org/node/1814&lt;/a&gt;. Does anyone know if there are other citizen journalism projects going on in the ctc vista world?&lt;/p&gt;
