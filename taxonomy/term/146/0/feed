 <title>My second week</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/141</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#39;m completing my second week at Aspiration. Monday and Tuesday were very interesting as I got to listen to the free training session we hosted for non-profits.  &amp;quot;Web Sites for Advocacy and Community Organizing: Basics, Essentials, and Best Practices&amp;quot;.  It was prepared by Gunner (from Aspiration) and David (from Radical Designs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I couldn&amp;#39;t help but listen as it took place 20 feet form my desk. :-)  It was incredibly informative and entertaining. We had about a dozen people here, and it seemed like everyone got a lot out of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, I&amp;#39;ve been  working on developing a test plan for the Social Source Commons website.  I&amp;#39;ve been looking for free tools to use for link-checking and QA testing.  I think I have a good plan, but if anyone has any suggestions I&amp;#39;m all ears. &lt;/p&gt;
