 <title>I&#039;m in for 3 more months : )</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1518</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hola hola mundo! We have had weird weather in June so far here in Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just finished mailing out hundreds of Wired for Wireless Reports. Thanks Stephen for shooting that email, by the way! I am continuing to send out reports. This brings me to the database. Bounced mailed reports are actually in our favor because it helps to clean the database.  And so now, updating the database is of primary focus as well as using GIS tools (most likely Google Maps/Earth) to map out our network.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I helped organize California Emerging Technology Fund’s (CETF) very first webcast of a new campaign they launched for Southern California titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://getconnectedtoday.com/&quot;&gt;Get Connected: Your Life Made Easier&lt;/a&gt;.  Thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bresee.org/&quot;&gt;Bresee Foundation&lt;/a&gt; who actually brought out the equipment for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justin.tv/clip/654017a18088b9e6&quot;&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I recently got a CTC VISTA extension for about three months.  I am blessed to get the extension. I enjoy working here, and there are still a few things I need to get done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be the last month a few of you will be posting. I thank you for your help and your service…I am sounding like the president, jeje. Please stay in (Twitter) touch: @OsoHormiguero.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Twitterverse, Tweet, Twa, Two!</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1482</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s been a lot of Twitter activity on this side of town. I have found that I can use Twitter as a news feed.  To tell you the truth, I think the future of news gathering will come from localized informants (that may or may &quot;Tweet&quot;) such as the #LongBeachWater.  In Twitter I follow organizations that may provide me with instant news articles or information on issues ranging from telecommunications policy to educational technology. I hope that more organizations from the L.A. metropolitan area can set up a Twitter and post news of their neighborhoods and communities. But assuming that organizations are at least connected to the web, they must understand if Twitter is right for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Twitter is right for the CCTPG. My current plan is to have as many of our organization partners on Twitter that we may be able to report in real time on the events that are occurring in their neighborhoods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plan for the month of May is to develop workshops for staff on Web 2.0 tools (i.e. Yammer) that may be useful for them. So what would be the difference between simply setting up a free Web 2.0 webinar and my proposed workshops? I understand some of the specific needs of my current organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I don’t know if you remember, but a couple of entries ago I mentioned how our organization was working on a &lt;em&gt;Wired for Wireless Report&lt;/em&gt; that surveyed municipal led wireless networks.  Personally, I haven’t done much of the work on this report, only edited some things here and there, but overall it looks grrrreeeaat! I hope to bring some copies to the Non-profit Technology Conference (aka the NTEN Conference) to distribute. So look and ask me for a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently housing for post first year of CTC VISTA is a question mark. Part of the decision depends on my future work site. I will keep you posted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope all had an enjoyable Easter!&lt;/p&gt;
