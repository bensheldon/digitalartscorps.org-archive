 <description>&lt;p&gt;Howdy dowdy!&lt;br /&gt;
Currently I am the last stages of helping out the Communications Team test email blast services. I know Vertical Response was highly recommended, but correct me if I&#039;m wrong, I found that if an org has multiple campaigns (i.e. newsletters) and one person subscribes for all of their campaigns, and then decides to unsubscribe from one campaign, then that person is unsubscribed from all campaigns. So I have decided to check VR off of my list and check out iContact, mailChimp, and constant contact. At this point, the skill that I need to learn is HTML. That way our org doesn&#039;t have to spend on a newsletter template consultant. Guess how much that costs? ~$350 bolivares (Venezuelan currency), jk...dollars.&lt;br /&gt;
Oh one more thing, Drupal and Joomla! may be on the backseat for a while, since our org is leaning towards redefining it&#039;s purpose etc. Which means that I will still be posting my articles relating to &quot;community technology&quot; but not so much trying to learn how to manage a CMS. Nevertheless, I have set a secret personal goal: to learn how to upgrade Drupal from v. 0.00001 to version 6 point something.&lt;br /&gt;
Last time I reported, Dia de Los Muertos at Olvera Street happened and the CTCNet Conference near Inglewood happened. One challenge that I overcame was not having foodstamps for about 2 weeks. This meant that there was no more peanuts and pistachio snacking at the office, sad face. But now I am changed man!&lt;br /&gt;
I am looking forward to eating sweet potato (aka Camote) pie (maybe one purchased from Albertsons, I will try to get one from a Farmers Market) and watching/playing football out in Mendota, Califas. Happy Turkey Day!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*forgive me for the dearth of postings (thanks GRE!).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Level up! &lt;plup&gt;</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1361</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Work has been picking up. We are in an interesting phase for Vertical Response (thanks Matt G. for the recommendation). I applied for those 10,000 free monthly email blasts and we got a response rather quickly. That built some momentum at CCTPG California Community Technology Policy Group), because afterwards I worked on a layout for our newsletter. I&#039;ve been working on our website&#039;s site map and wireframe using Microsoft Visio, ooooo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, about three weeks ago, I was able to make it to an event put on by the Pat Brown Institute of Public Affairs. The topic for discussion was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBf4D7210pY&quot; technology and the future of civic&gt;“Technology and the Future of Civic Engagement.” &lt;/a&gt; We met some interesting people at this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webinars: I hope to apply to the Drupal and the website securities webinar from NTEN. I think today is the deadline to apply for IST funds for the Drupal webinar, because the webinar will be put on exactly 2 weeks from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to the CTCnet Conference and seeing as many CTC VISTAS as possible. The three CCTPG staff have signed up for the conference (including me). So I hope to see you all soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On other Non-related work issues: it seems like my foodstamps are on hold. But I will try to clear that up as soon as I can. This past weekend, my brother and I went to Mexicali, Mexico for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiestasdelsol.com.mx/&quot; title=&quot;Las Fiestas del Sol&quot;&gt;Las Fiestas del Sol&lt;/a&gt; (it’s like a huge city fair). This means I have been able to save some money from my stipends (keep in mind I have no car and I live with 5 other people, jeje). So, I am thankful for CCTPG that they have been able to cover my transportation costs. I usually grocery shop after work or in the weekends, &lt;em&gt;todo a pie&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last fun one: Halloween costume: &lt;a href=&quot;http://theluchadores.blogspot.com/2007/07/octagon.html&quot; title=&quot;Octagon Mask&quot;&gt;Octagon Mask&lt;/a&gt; (only), which I bought while in Mexicali. Octagon was my favorite Mexican Luchador from the AAA league.&lt;/p&gt;
