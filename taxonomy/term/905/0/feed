 <title>The time has come to say goodbye...</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! This is my last blog entry as a CTC VISTA. It has been a very fun and rewarding year for me.  It all started when I moved to California from Philly. I still can&#039;t believe I up and left Philly and all my family and friends to move to a place where I had no permanent place to live, everything was totally unfamiliar, and where everyone (except for 1 person) was a stranger. I remember feeling so scared yet excited at the same time. I didn&#039;t know what to expect. My transition was rough not only for me but for my cat that I dragged along (sorry Meechie). I was fortunate to be temporarily housed by my co-worker and his wife for a month and then again for a few more months after my first roommate situation went bad. But then I ended up with a really cool and compatible roommate in June and both Meechie and I have felt at home ever since. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where did the time go? It feels like I&#039;ve only been here a few months. I guess time really does fly when you&#039;re having fun. I still feel so new to the Bay Area and have many more things to do, places to see, and cool people to meet. I have accomplished a lot in the last year though. I worked really hard creating and enhancing curriculum for the computer classes that we provide, I taught digital storytelling workshops to the Oakland youth, created a databases, refurbished computers, installed computer labs in schools and other organizations, and helped develop the website. We distributed over 2000 computers and installed about 1500 to schools in the year I served. I&#039;ve gained so much knowledge and experience from doing these things and it amazes me how far I&#039;ve come in one year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now my year as a VISTA has come to an end today. But I had a fitting ending to my year. I participating in an MLK day of service at Sobrante Park Elementary School. My organization, along with Hands on Bay Area and Kaiser Permanente Hospital, installed 50 computers in the school. I had a blast and I scored a really cool MLK day of service shirt (gotta love free stuff). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So tomorrow I will be an official OTX-West employee. I will be doing much of the same and then some. I feel like I did everything I set out to do and I&#039;m really proud of myself for that.  I really made a difference in the lives of many Oakland residents, in that my service was a step forward in eliminating the digital divide. But it doesn&#039;t stop here. There is still so much to do and so much room to grow. I&#039;m looking forward to what 2008 will bring and hope that it&#039;s as good to me as 2007. Good luck to you all and keep up the great work! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace out,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naomi&lt;/p&gt;
