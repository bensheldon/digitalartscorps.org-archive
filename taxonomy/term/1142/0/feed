 <title>A Donation Request Letter Template</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/964</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Just something I have been using to gain donations and thought I would share. I found a lot of companies want an explanation of who you are representing, what they are doing, and why they want a donation. Many also require you to fill out a request form as well. I took some time and wrote a simple letter that explains all of that. A master letter that we can change the statement about what we want to suit our needs. I attach a business card and proof that we are a non - profit organization to it with a paper clip. Paper clip comes in handy to attach their request forms if they have one right to the information they require. I have had great success with this so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Whom It May Concern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;My name is Rayna Ramirez. I am the AmeriCorps CTC Vista project coordinator for the YES (Young Entrepreneurs Society) program located in Orange. We are a non – profit organization 501(c) (3). We fund ourselves through our FedEx and UPS shipping store. We are working to improve the accessibility of our facility, for anyone who has any type of disability through a grant from C4ALL for TechACCESS. For more information about YES and TechACCESS please see our website at:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://yes-inc.org/&quot; title=&quot;http://yes-inc.org/&quot;&gt;http://yes-inc.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are seeking a donation of a gift certificate(s). This gift certificate will be used to assist in raising funds for our efforts. We would like to request the value to be no less than $25.00. If you would like to donate a value greater than that amount we would be grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;The goal of TechACCESS is to help residents with disabilities in our 9-town rural region expand their social, academic, and livelihood horizons by making local programs, services and opportunities more accessible by removing physical barriers to facilities; equipping computers with accessible hardware and software; and helping organizations and businesses make their materials, websites, programs, products and services more accessible. It will also work to increase accessibility awareness in the community as a whole. The project will be guided and implemented by a voluntary committee of people with disabilities, staff from public and non-profit agencies that serve them, and community volunteers. The committee will be supported by Rayna Ramirez an AmeriCorp*VISTA volunteer coordinator and Alan Paige YES member liaison. It will develop its capacity through the process of making YES&#039; facility, programs, cyber cafe and retail business accessible (May-September 2007) before putting its skills, resources and experience at the service of other area organizations and businesses.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
