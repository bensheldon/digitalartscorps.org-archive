 <title>First Day at PSO</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/922</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was the 1st day of PSO.  Mostly, we had meetings and filled out paperwork.  It was nice to discover that not everyone was right out of college.      A few of us had several years of work under our belts.   Even my roommate had years of experience in teaching and photojournalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digressing a bit, it certainly is warm and humid.  It made for a sleepless night last night since there was no air conditioning.  It gets warm in eastern Washington state, but the humidity there is in the teens rather than the eighties.  I also have air conditioning at home.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>At PSO...first blog</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/76</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, as I slowly reach maximum saturation of information, I am asked to throw down some words as my first blog entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loving PSO, getting lots of information and beginning some great friendships. I&amp;#39;m really hoping that some  interaction and information can be shared through this site, as I forsee the need for contact out there once I recede into isolation... all alone in the DC metro.&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/71627661@N00/52026820/in/set-72057594071091584/&quot; alt=&quot;My nephew in an elmo outfit&quot; title=&quot;My nephew in an elmo outfit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, details...I&amp;#39;m Carl Seifert. A cajun from Louisiana, now a resident of Arlington, Virginia, I got connected with a great CTC in Alexandria (literally across the street from Arlington) and started teaching adult computer literacy classes to out mainly immigrant clientel.  After a while, the relationship was such that they wanted me hired on full time, but didnt have the money to pay me, soooo enter CTC Americorp VISTA project.  Now, i&amp;#39;m going to be serving in a new capacity to increase our organization&amp;#39;s ability to keep up with our students.  During my tenure, I am charged with creating a way to not lose track of our students, some of whom lack consistent phone lines. This is in order to help with fundraising and increase our capacity to continue to serve the community even after their courses at Computer C.O.R.E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is all for now, but hopefully I&amp;#39;ll keep up with the blogging and there will be lots of interaction between all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
