 <description>&lt;p&gt;Nine months since &lt;a title=&quot; A bit of crossposting on digital storytelling&quot; href=&quot;http://ctcvista.org/node/1363&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I took the digital storytelling class at PCM&lt;/a&gt;, I have finally finished my digital story!&lt;br /&gt;
One of the on-call media ed instructors, Peta Mni came up with the last component of my piece: the title. Yes, it was that hard to come up with one.&lt;/p&gt;
