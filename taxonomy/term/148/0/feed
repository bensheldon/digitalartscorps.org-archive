 <title>The DASCorps Survival Guide: Strategic Planning</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1803</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;At some point during your VISTA year you may asked to take part in or prepare a section for your organization’s strategic planning. You may even be asked to coordinate it as past VISTAs have been. Or your organization may not even have a plan past the next 3 months. This section is an introduction to the concepts and methods of Strategic Planning you may have to use during your service year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Strategic Planning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Strategic planning is typically a 1-3 year forecast of what the organization will look like and how it will “get there”. In the case of nonprofits, especially over the last several years, strategic planning has become key to being more &quot;competitive&quot; within the social service sector as funding is dries up for an ever increasing population of nonprofit organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is the right time to plan?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- There are no major professional or personal conflicts between executives or board members&lt;br /&gt;
- The executive director and/or board president are committed to planning&lt;br /&gt;
- There are enough resources and time to devote to the process&lt;br /&gt;
- There are no major decisions or organizational chaos in the next several months that could undermine the process (i.e. leadership changes)&lt;br /&gt;
- Your organization has been operating to several years&lt;br /&gt;
- Your organization is committed top-down to implementing any and all strategies developed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Strategic planning can occur over the course of an organizational retreat where board members, directors, and staff come together for a day or weekend to plan out their future. These retreats usually happen off-site at hotels, restaurants, etc. and are reasonably well catered (or should be!). However, the plan needs to be revisited, revised, and evaluated throughout the year on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start BIG go small&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The strategic planning process typically starts from the big picture (Vision/Mission) and drills down to the most practical action steps (Objectives) needed to fulfill the plan. Each stage in the process determines the shape and detail of the next stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategic planning process is framed by three key questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where have you been? (What do we do/have we done?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where do you want to go? (What will we do/want to do?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you get there? (How will we accomplish that?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where have you been?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To know where you want to go you first have to know where you’ve been as an organization. To start, evaluate performance in the last year. Look at both successes and failures and try to understand why in each specific goal your organization did or did not succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If work is not well documented, you can create surveys for staff and/or the community you serve to better understand your organization’s achievements or lack-there-of. Bad news usually never flows up, so your executive staff may not even be aware of certain problems. Anonymous surveys may get at some of these unsaid issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back is also a good opportunity to revisit your organization’s mission statement. Good questions to ask when refocusing your mission statement include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the purpose of the nonprofit (this is usually the Vision statement)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What actions are the nonprofit going to take to achieve this vision?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is going to benefit from these actions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do you want to go?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now that you now where you’ve been, it’s time to look at where your organization wants to go. Before you jump right into defining goals, you first should define all the factors that go into the future success or failure of your organization. The SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) Analysis does this very well. By breaking down both internal and external factors that influence your organization’s growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great framework to explore the external influences on your organization is the PEST (Political, Economic, Social, and Technological) Analysis. Sometimes added to this are also legal, education, and even environmental influences. Keeping all these external factors in mind is especially critical to nonprofits that work in and impact nearly all these external variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will you get there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So you know where your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats lie, but now what? It’s time to make your SWOT analysis actionable by putting them in a new chart that pits your strengths to your threats, your weaknesses with to opportunities, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways of how this might work using the previous SWOT example. Note that each idea that comes out of this analysis can be categorized as a “Goal”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By pairing up with other local nonprofits (Opportunity) you can collaborate on projects which will decrease the workload on your staff (Weakness)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since your last initiative was successful (Strength), you can market this to foundations that now could potentially fund you (Opportunity) while also using your strong board (Strength) to make contacts within those foundations &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Final Product&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With goals developed from looking at your SWOT and from staff/director/board/community input, you can now begin the process of further breaking down the plan from organizational goals to specific objectives and next actions. Without objectives and next steps, your strategic plan will be highly ineffective towards reaching goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to lay out objectives in detail is to give each one to the person whose role it is to complete it and have them generate all the next actions. At this point in your strategic planning process, you begin to find overlap with project management, as each objective becomes more-or-less a separate project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A finalized strategic plan includes, but is not limited to, the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vision &amp;amp; Mission Statements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long-term Strategies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeted Client/Community Profiles (not discussed in this session)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stakeholder Analysis (not discussed in this session)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SWOT Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategic Objectives for Goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next Actions and Steps for Each Objective&lt;br /&gt;
Financial Projections (VISTAs almost never engage with these)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last Minute Tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some common problems people run into during planning or implementing a strategic plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No plan for implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No point person to continually evaluate plan’s implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one communicates or disseminates the plan to the entire organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting stuck in the day-to-day and losing sight of long-term goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The plan is never integrated or looked at as part of the day-to-day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategic planning and evaluation occurs once every year or two&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one is accountable for their own objectives or next actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 <title>Building the Project&#039;s Capacity</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/993</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve been doing a lot of research on capacity building:  What is it? How can we evaluate it? Is there a “best practice” approach to capacity building?  Is there a common conceptual framework for capacity building?  What are the benefits of doing it?  Who should do it? How do you promote capacity building in your organization? In what ways can CTC VISTA build its capacity?  How does CTC VISTA help individual VISTAs build the capacity in their organizations? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve found some helpful resources that address some of these questions.  I’ve been using them, along with a book titled &lt;em&gt;Communication Planning: An Integrated Approach&lt;/em&gt;, to help with CTC VISTA’s ongoing strategic planning.  The Project is also working on developing internal communications, outreach, and fundraising plans that summarize the goals and implementation procedures for those areas.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capacity building work we’re doing so far doesn’t change what the Project does, rather it provides a useful framework that helps us stay focused, productive, and capable of evolving with the needs of those we serve.  It also helps clarify the Project and eliminate transitional issues in an organization with an inherently high turnover rate.  Eventually the Project might develop new ways in which to evaluate its own capacity building, and the capacity being built by individual VISTAs.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d be very interested to hear anyone’s thoughts on or their experiences with these issues.  I’m attaching two of the resources I’ve found very helpful in this process.  Here, too, is a link to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.managementhelp.org/org_perf/capacity.htm&quot; title=&quot;Free Management Library&quot;&gt;Free Management Library&lt;/a&gt;, which has additional resources and links.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Nonprofit Communications 2.0</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/720</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;embed style=&quot;width:400px; height:326px;&quot; id=&quot;VideoPlayback&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; src=&quot;http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=-8837019602624623626&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; flashvars=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I attended NTEN&#039;s 2007 &lt;a href=&quot;http://nten.org/ntc&quot;&gt;Nonprofit Technology Conference&lt;/a&gt; and sat in on a wonderful session entitled &lt;strong&gt;Nonprofit Communications 2.0: Seven Steps to Transform Your Organization.&lt;/strong&gt; Led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cctv.org/index.php?SiteAlias=cctv&amp;amp;PageAlias=CCTV_Staff#LG&quot;&gt;Lauren-Glenn Davitian&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cctv.org/&quot;&gt;CCTV Center for Media and Democracy&lt;/a&gt;, the session provided a strong framework for nonprofits to better communicate in an increasingly networked society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(crossposted from &lt;a href=&quot;http://island94.org&quot;&gt;my personal blog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also very lucky to serve with Lauren-Glenn on the  editorial board of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://communitymediareview.org/&quot;&gt;Community Media Review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video itself is approximately 1 hour, 24 minutes long and worth every second, but I included my notes from the session below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Community building talent is the single most important resource in the modern world.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;attribution&quot;&gt;Peter Drucker&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to engage and mobilize members&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Communications framework for thinking about how organizational objectives are met through interaction.  The correlating Development framework is in parenthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome&lt;/strong&gt; (Prospect)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educate&lt;/strong&gt; (Cultivation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask&lt;/strong&gt; (Involvement)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank&lt;/strong&gt; (Stewardship)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Seven Steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;: Defining your goal (What behavior are you trying to change in undertaking a communications strategy?), audience (an explicit, targeted &quot;who&quot; and their values), evaluating your infrastructure (orthodoxies, structure, time, leadership)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awareness&lt;/strong&gt;: Start by searching &lt;a href=&quot;http://nten.org&quot;&gt;NTEN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://techsoup.org&quot;&gt;TechSoup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idealware.org/&quot;&gt;Idealware&lt;/a&gt;, etc. (Link Research)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;/strong&gt;: A discipline of doing things.  How are stories told, infrastructure built and actions communicated to regular people?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Production&lt;/strong&gt;: &quot;The currency of the new world&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Support&lt;/strong&gt;: An example: how to know when to build and when to buy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Partnerships&lt;/strong&gt;: Who is going to stand up for you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning&lt;/strong&gt;: What are the components that revolve around your goal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other Links&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.spinproject.org/modinput4.php?modin=56&quot;&gt;Strategic Communications Plan Generator&lt;/a&gt; from The SPIN Project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npowerseattle.org/education/resources/communications.htm&quot;&gt;Tech Savvy Communications Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; from NPower Seattle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storytelling: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agoodmanonline.com/&quot;&gt;Andy Goodman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gilbert.org/&quot;&gt;The Gilbert Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I shot this video with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Casio-Exilim-EX-S600-Digital-Optical/dp/B000E158D4&quot;&gt;Casio EX-S600&lt;/a&gt;, which shoots full-frame (640 x 480) MPEG-4 video.  With a two gigabyte SD Card it can shoot approximately an hour and a half of video at medium quality before its battery dies.  The Casio&#039;s AVI wrapper is incompatible with iMovie (or any Quicktime decoder), so I first used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techspansion.com/visualhub/&quot;&gt;VisualHub&lt;/a&gt; to repackage the video as an MP4 before importing into iMovie to add titles.  I exported from iMovie as DV and then converted that with VisualHub into MPEG-4.  Compressed and at quarter-frame (320 x 240) the entire video was 105 MB.  This time I uploaded to Google Video since &lt;a href=&quot;http://blip.tv&quot;&gt;Blip.tv&lt;/a&gt; stalled out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Leading by example...sort of</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/142</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After a spent the week trying to catch up with all the VISTAs under my care, encouraging them all to blog and read the blogs, I realized I haven&amp;#39;t really blogged myself.  &lt;em&gt;What AM I working on?  &lt;/em&gt;Well the first three weeks as an official VISTA leader has been a lot about finding a balance between two new roles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role 1 : &lt;/strong&gt;VISTA Leader at CTC VISTA Project at UMass Boston&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role was a little easier to figure out, since I&amp;#39;ve got the Project pretty much figured out by now.  In fact, most of these first three weeks have been about helping the Project HQ staff get on the same page and think strategically about where the Project wants to go.  I hosted a little strategic planning retreat at my new apartment in Medford, where we compared assumptions, knowledge of the Project and whittled it all down into some concrete goals and actions for the Project.  Most of the fall will be consumed with populating the new &lt;a href=&quot;/resources&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CTC VISTA resource portal&lt;/a&gt; and putting the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/digest/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Digest&lt;/a&gt; together with &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/976&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Erin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Program Coordinator at &lt;a href=&quot;http://massimpact.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;massIMPACT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I just got that title today, mostly because we had to figure out something to put on my new business cards.]  Now, working with massIMPACT is all new.  massIMPACT is a non-profit housed at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.masshousing.com/portal/server.pt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MassHousing&lt;/a&gt; that works to provide support to technology in housing developments accross MA.  So far, it&amp;#39;s done work in digital storytelling train-the-trainer projects and partnered with Northeastern University among other things.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three weeks were mostly shadowing my supervisor, &lt;a href=&quot;http://massimpact.org/members/advisory_board/thaddeus_miles.shtml&quot;&gt;Thaddeus Miles&lt;/a&gt;, and being amazed at the amount of people he interacts with and is able to remember all their names and stories.  Meeting everyone and figuring out the housing development environment has been fascinating for me because I know a lot about non-profits in Boston but not much about this group.  The funniest part is how amazed folks are that I want to take the T to these meetings - I think it&amp;#39;s a combo of fearing for the &amp;quot;white girl&amp;quot; in the Roxbury/Dorchester and not liking to walk on their part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other sub-role I have at massIMPACT is project managing the development of a collaboration portal for community digital storytelling facilitators at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.storiesforchang.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;StoriesforChange.net.&lt;/a&gt;  I&amp;#39;ve been reading as much as I can of emails from all the volunteers who want to build this site for sharing resources, curriculum, and lessons learned while providing place to publish stories as well.  I&amp;#39;m excited because this site is truly a project fueled by the users (and not by a funder or higher power) and I get to work with new VISTA &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/968&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jessica McCoy&lt;/a&gt; at the Center for Digital Storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pazonada.blogspot.com/2006/09/mit-and-weird-day-at-cms.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/427/1151/0/unnamed-image-1-787553.jpg&quot; border=&quot;3&quot; alt=&quot;D on Audobon&amp;#039;s moblog out with CMS Grad students&quot; title=&quot;D on Audobon&amp;#039;s moblog out with CMS Grad students&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;120&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On a personal note&lt;/em&gt;, I spent a good amount of free time these past couple weeks seriously thinking and researching my graduate school possibilities.  I highly enjoyed the session at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/cms/&quot;&gt;Comparative Media Studies Program at MIT&lt;/a&gt;, especially because I connected with another prospective student (Ms. Audobon, who &lt;a href=&quot;http://pazonada.blogspot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;moblogs&lt;/a&gt; and with whom I had way too much in common with for Fate not to be involved) and a few of the current grad students.  Imagine, Danielle at MIT....&lt;/p&gt;
