 <title>Finally</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1763</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I have something to show for my time with the Transmission Project so far. Today I published an article on past Corps members&#039; experiences working with Salesforce databases. I would like to thank Billy especially for creating the graphics and prepping the document for PDF format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article is available to download as a pdf below, and you can read my introduction on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://transmissionproject.org/current&quot;&gt;current&lt;/a&gt; page of the Transmission Project website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article&#039;s intended audience is really other organizations, but I encourage anyone who is working with Salesforce -- or any CRM -- to take a look at what we&#039;ve learned. Anyone interested in how the Transmission Project approaches its past partnerships may also find something useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that, in conducting my research, having access to other VISTAs&#039; field reports is extremely helpful when trying to get a sense of your perspectives on the projects you are tackling. I was able to search through field reports to learn not only when Corps members encountered problems with Salesforce and what they had to say about it, but also when they felt they had been successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&#039;m trying to say is don&#039;t stop reporting because what you say here can actually provide an important resource for me (and others, but do you really require any reason to post other than that it will make my job easier?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over and out,&lt;br /&gt;
Howie&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Wait, it&#039;s fall already?</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1598</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Dascorps folks! The time is zooming by, as several of you have mentioned. Things are good here, though very busy! A few things that are gong on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-PCF just launched a new project today - &lt;a href=&quot;http://videowtf.com/&quot; title=&quot;http://videowtf.com/&quot;&gt;http://videowtf.com/&lt;/a&gt; - it&#039;s a collaborative Q&amp;amp;A site related to video production, so I&#039;d love it if you all would stop by and ask/answer questions, and spread the word!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Several Miro Community sites are now live! There are live sites at &lt;a href=&quot;http://video.medfield.tv/&quot; title=&quot;http://video.medfield.tv/&quot;&gt;http://video.medfield.tv/&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;http://mirocommunity.access-scat.org/&quot; title=&quot;http://mirocommunity.access-scat.org/&quot;&gt;http://mirocommunity.access-scat.org/&lt;/a&gt;, and Erica&#039;s QUQ site will be at their domain soon, but for now is at &lt;a href=&quot;http://quq.mirocommunity.org/&quot; title=&quot;http://quq.mirocommunity.org/&quot;&gt;http://quq.mirocommunity.org/&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote a blog post about Miro Community for pegpoint @ &lt;a href=&quot;http://pegpoint.org/2009/10/05/connecting-communities-through-online-video&quot; title=&quot;http://pegpoint.org/2009/10/05/connecting-communities-through-online-video&quot;&gt;http://pegpoint.org/2009/10/05/connecting-communities-through-online-video&lt;/a&gt; . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve talked to several of you about the Miro Community project, but I thought this would be a good time/place to say that if you think your organization would be interested in moderating/cultivating a local online video community, I&#039;d love to talk to you. PCF has a grant from the Knight Foundation to create these local video sites, and I personally think they can be pretty hard-core and awesome, so I would encourage folks to think about creating one with us if you do local media work! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a few other sites that are in the process of being created. So far, the biggest challenge is convincing partners (other than Erica, who got it right away!) of the importance of doing outreach around the site and trying to really make sure we&#039;re on the same page about creating a local video community, not just a cool way to display the station videos (though it is that, too). I&#039;m reading up on a variety of community media projects to help me express this better and figure out how we fit in. Besides the local sites, I&#039;m still working on my feminist video site, now housed at nist.tv but not yet public. It&#039;s been interesting to me in doing planning for that the different visions people have for community media online. Is it more important to have a curated collection/ an editor&#039;s voice, or to have an archive? How do we encourage people to make media that others actually want to watch - what does that look like? These are some of the things I&#039;m thinking a lot about as I continue with that project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have finished a draft &quot;Partner Guide&quot; to Miro Community which I will attach once I polish it off a little more, by next month. It&#039;s nice to have something tangible like this, though I have found that with this project, the chicken and egg problem comes up again and again. So I&#039;ve written a guide, but I don&#039;t yet have too many real world examples, but it&#039;s hard to get real world partners when I don&#039;t have a guide/materials to show them... etc. I have grand visions for what is possible but sometimes it feels like people need to see those visions in order to get to them, which is frustrating at times. But we&#039;re forging ahead and it&#039;s working out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-I&#039;m headed to Public Media Camp in DC next week. I&#039;m excited about the opportunities there, I&#039;ll let you know how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-I&#039;m still getting used to blog post writing style, which I&#039;m not always the most comfortable with. But I think this is one of those areas where you learn by doing, so I&#039;m trying to just keep going for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-I have a ton of PDFs and books that I feel like I should read to help with my project and my overall knowledge, but I haven&#039;t been able to get around to doing it. I&#039;m traveling this week, so I&#039;m hoping that will afford some time to dig in to some interesting and relevant material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Thanks for all the advice on my previous post. Still adjusting to desk work, etc., and trying to learn to steadily plow through activities and keep track of them along the way. Something I find really interesting about the organizational culture here is that things are very flexible, so our focus can quickly shift. I like this, but it definitely takes some getting used to, so I&#039;m trying to learn to be more flexible while also trying to stay on top of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-This month I&#039;m looking forward to seeing the first few sites develop and thrive, as well as setting up new ones. We&#039;re releasing our .8 version of the software soon, and now that several sites are up and running I&#039;m really excited to see what will happen with them and how we can build real local video communities. With that comes some anxiety about the collaborative process - except for the feminist video site, I&#039;m not in control of content or really of outreach, so while I can help our partners with those areas, it&#039;s at times a challenge to be removed from direct development. But, again, a good one, and a great learning opportunity about capacity building in general.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Capacity Building</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1435</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Honestly, in July, I had no idea of the concept of “building capacity”. But today I am getting to see some results.  All it took was almost blinded diligent work in the first couple of months as a VISTA.  It began with surveying email news blast tools (I know it’s very low tech work) and finally choosing Constant Contact (sorry VR peeps).  In December, I set up workshops for the assistant staff at Community Partners so that they could get familiar with the tool.  Then I “prairie dogged” (as one staff member puts it) around to see if any of them needed any help.  Then first week of January came and the assistant staff was set with a new task: get the word out to our constituents that our CEO/President will be speaking at an evening event.  They use the tool and skills they built to email blast our constituents and as a result, the event was completely booked.  This has never happened to the third party entity who was organizing this event!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I am working on managing CCTPG’s database by tidying it up. Last month, I created my &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.switchpod.com//users/cctpg/CTCNetMainPodcast4.mp3&quot; title=&quot;first podcast&quot;&gt;first podcast &lt;/a&gt;(the very famous Dan Strangl is in it); I hope to improve significantly on this new acquired skill (especially on my reporting voice).  I hope to do more of these audio podcast and get involved with video podcast, that way I can build more capacity by helping our Communications Team create their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of policy, we are involved in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://internetforeveryone.org/&quot; title=&quot;Internet for Everyone campaign&quot;&gt;Internet for Everyone campaign&lt;/a&gt; and the Digital Inclusion strategy for the City of Los Angeles.  These are both very exciting policy issues that I hope to get more involved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half way to the end of this program, I am feeling good about the energy I have placed in this organization. Happy New Years, Happy Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and Happy Obama’s Inauguration Day!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>6 Volunteer Management Presentations</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1052</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;These are some of the resources I present to donors and to agencies. They are rough and they require extra explanation in many places. But, since I haven&#039;t trademarked them, unfortunately, I am sharing them with you. Feel free to email me with any questions...I also have a list of websites and reading that supplement this. I&#039;ll get it on the wiki sometime soon hopfully.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Building the Project&#039;s Capacity</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/993</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve been doing a lot of research on capacity building:  What is it? How can we evaluate it? Is there a “best practice” approach to capacity building?  Is there a common conceptual framework for capacity building?  What are the benefits of doing it?  Who should do it? How do you promote capacity building in your organization? In what ways can CTC VISTA build its capacity?  How does CTC VISTA help individual VISTAs build the capacity in their organizations? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve found some helpful resources that address some of these questions.  I’ve been using them, along with a book titled &lt;em&gt;Communication Planning: An Integrated Approach&lt;/em&gt;, to help with CTC VISTA’s ongoing strategic planning.  The Project is also working on developing internal communications, outreach, and fundraising plans that summarize the goals and implementation procedures for those areas.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capacity building work we’re doing so far doesn’t change what the Project does, rather it provides a useful framework that helps us stay focused, productive, and capable of evolving with the needs of those we serve.  It also helps clarify the Project and eliminate transitional issues in an organization with an inherently high turnover rate.  Eventually the Project might develop new ways in which to evaluate its own capacity building, and the capacity being built by individual VISTAs.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d be very interested to hear anyone’s thoughts on or their experiences with these issues.  I’m attaching two of the resources I’ve found very helpful in this process.  Here, too, is a link to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.managementhelp.org/org_perf/capacity.htm&quot; title=&quot;Free Management Library&quot;&gt;Free Management Library&lt;/a&gt;, which has additional resources and links.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Big Job</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/959</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been here two full weeks now and my boss has been gone for a week and 1/2 of that. Plus, she&#039;s going on vacay next week, so I&#039;m kinda winging it. The good news about that is that I&#039;m getting the opportunity to settle into the job and people watch while getting comfortable. The bad news is that my boss and a few others are the only ones that know I&#039;m a VISTA. Everybody has been told, but apparently sharp memories are scarce around here. The sticky part is that the United Way has what they call a &quot;loaned executive&quot; program where companies extend their employees for a certain amount of time for a specific project here. People think I&#039;m one of those and there are some serious territorial issues surrounding that and the money that goes with it. I&#039;ve just stopped trying to correct people-they&#039;ll either get on board or get out of my way sooner or later I figure. I was told by one Senior VP of Resource Investment, in no uncertain terms, that I was not needed. When I asked what she thought I did, she admitted she didn&#039;t know-but she knew I wasn&#039;t needed. Funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&#039;ve got more of an uphill battle in a sharply divided workplace than I had originally thought. The really good news is that IBM and Sysco Inc. are funneling a lot of money into bringing the United Way&#039;s volunteering program online. It&#039;s self serving, they want a place to send their employees to volunteer so their community presence is increased--but hey, it gets me guaranteed volunteers! Right now, more than anything, I&#039;m conducting research to help formulate a plan of action to get us more involved with our external volunteers and outreach. I&#039;ve had positive feedback from my bosses and other more direct co-workers who actually understand what my position is. I&#039;m very encouraged about the future of the project and where it can go--which is a good thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week I will be conducting interviews in a psuedo-digital storytelling medium as the program Teaming 4 Technology gathers data for grant applications. T4T distributes computers to organizations that apply to us to help bridge the digital divide. I&#039;m going on the 10th to interview a center for the mentally handicapped and how they use their computers from us. I&#039;m really looking forward to that. I&#039;ll try and post pictures. These kids come and fill our vending machines, so I&#039;ve already met some of them and the staff and they&#039;re just fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have amassed a tremendous amount of research and data on volunteer management in a broad sense. I&#039;m going to try, when I get a chance, to post some of the better info and links on the Wiki, but until then-email me and I&#039;ll be glad to share if you need.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>FINALLY blogging!</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/587</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, I haven&amp;#39;t blogged since November.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to do it. Thinking about doing it. Feeling like I should do it. But now I&amp;#39;m actually doing it. A nice quiet Friday afternoon presents the perfect time to blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; So, what have I been up to? Planning workshops, teaching workshops, going to meetings, working on curriculum materials, and helping with a website project for digital storytelling facilitators.  That&amp;#39;s the past few months in a nutshell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; To expand on a few aspects: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workshops: I guess that teaching workshops begins to cross over into the &amp;quot;direct service&amp;quot; category, but workshops are the heart of what we do at Center for Digital Storytelling, so if I didn&amp;#39;t participate in some of them I wouldn&amp;#39;t be very helpful to the organization. Teaching in the workshops has shown me what stuff people consistently trip over in the software, which helps me know how to structure our new software guides. It also has shown me how much work is involved in putting on workshops, especially those customized for a specific group. There&amp;#39;s literally months of email exchanges, meetings, logistics planning, and recruiting before the workshop takes place. Then there&amp;#39;s three incredibly intense days of work, and maybe a week or so of tying up the loose ends. (More if the project involves special curriculum materials or a custom DVD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you all don&amp;#39;t really care about all of that. What I think may be relevant is the point that I&amp;#39;m sure all of you are observing on your own: nonprofits are hard work. It seems that there&amp;#39;s never enough time, money, expertise, or staff to get everything done. Now I understand why CDS has tutorials that are probably 3 years old and full of typos. It&amp;#39;s because just running the day-to-day operations of the organization takes so much work that there&amp;#39;s not much energy left over for creating the tools that would actually make our work easier. I&amp;#39;m still trying to figure out how to balance that. Example: If I take three hours of my day today, I can get one rough-draft tutorial fully edited, printed, and ready to use. That means I&amp;#39;ll be three hours behind on everything else, but I won&amp;#39;t have to scramble at the next workshop to print out a half-done tutorial (and neither will my coworkers.) If I take three days to get all of our lab computers in tip-top shape, we&amp;#39;ll probably be set for the next couple months. But I&amp;#39;ll  never have three free days because of meetings, phone calls, deadlines, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve some of these problems, my very supportive supervisors suggested that I hire some volunteer interns to help with the more basic tasks so I could focus on the tutorials and other capacity building that requires some know-how. This seemed like a great idea, but now I&amp;#39;ve spent a good chunk of time soliciting interns, interviewing candidates, and training the three that I selected. And the one day a week that they are here, I get less done because they have a lot of questions. I&amp;#39;m hoping that this is because they are new, and as they get more experienced they will be more self-sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to sum up, I&amp;#39;m feeling a bit overworked. I think I need to start a yoga class or something to destress a bit. The good news is I&amp;#39;m learning lots, even if sometimes I&amp;#39;m learning it the hard way. &lt;/p&gt;
