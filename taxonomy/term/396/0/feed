 <title>i am having a philosophical dilemma</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/317</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I&amp;#39;m back.  Danielle just reverse psychologized me into posting a new blog.  She&amp;#39;s good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Anyway, everything is going fine here, &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt;.   I mean, I&amp;#39;m surviving.  I&amp;#39;m eating pretty well.  I have a good number of friends here in Portland.  And PCM just hired some new part-time staff, all of whom are exceptionally cute.  I even have a really great boss.  What is there to complain about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Well...I guess I&amp;#39;m just not sure what I&amp;#39;m doing.  Or why I&amp;#39;m doing it.  I became a CTC VISTA, because I wanted to feel like I was doing something good for the country.  Giving something back.  And I&amp;#39;m not going to join the military, so this seemed like the way to go.  So here I am, using my skizzills to help young people learn how to use video equipment.  Which is fun and all...but I can&amp;#39;t really see that I am doing any good whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Aren&amp;#39;t there already more than enough wannabe directors and producers and movie stars already?  Don&amp;#39;t kids already get more than enough media in their lives, without me pushing even more on them?   Why am I building an OLLIE website (and myspace page) when kids already spend too much time online as it is?  I honestly feel like all I am doing is helping to provide kids with another cool way to get out of doing actual work.  So what is the benefit?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; There are some (non-CTC) VISTAs just down the street at the African American Health Coalition, and I can&amp;#39;t be sure (because for some reason they don&amp;#39;t have any interest in talking to me), but it feels to me like they are doing a good service for the community.  I mean &amp;quot;Health&amp;quot;!  And &amp;quot;African American&amp;quot;!  And &amp;quot;Coalition&amp;quot;!  And what am I doing?  I&amp;#39;m helping kids watch tv.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not trying to badmouth the program.  I guess I just need reassurance that I&amp;#39;m actually helping somehow.   Because really, if I&amp;#39;m not somehow benefiting the community, then why am I doing this? &lt;/p&gt;
