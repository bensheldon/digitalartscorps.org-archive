 <title>Reading my way to victory</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1588</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In my first month at Prometheus, I did a lot of reading. I familiarized myself with some of the issues under discussion at the FCC, such as rural commercial radio, digital radio, Tribal radio, and diversity reporting. Part of my job is translating these complex regulatory issues into terms that ordinary people can understand, so I first need to build my own expertise on radio regulation. It&#039;s an ongoing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from reading, one of the best ways I&#039;ve learned about the organization has been by volunteering to edit various documents that others are producing. By editing grant applications, newsletter articles, and press releases, I quickly learned about Prometheus’ current activities and priorities. I also joined a group tasked with rewriting our mission, vision, and values statements, which has helped me to understand the big-picture aims of the organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tasks have been helpful in defining my own role at Prometheus, based on the needs of the organization and my own skill set. In the coming months, I plan to build a strategy to make Prometheus’ vast knowledge of media regulation more “user-friendly” and more widely distributed (mostly through blog entries and other articles). I also hope to reorganize our internal files on regulatory policy and to help with a more accessible regulatory policy section on the website.&lt;/p&gt;
