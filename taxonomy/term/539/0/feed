 <title>Woah grant $</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/542</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This past week has been utterly ridiculous &amp;amp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;just unfathomable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.-lol (wait let me spell check .……..ok I&amp;#39;m good). The premiere partnership inner city high school for The Media Aid Center just received a big grant from the desk of Arnold &amp;quot;the Governator&amp;quot;. This is all allocated to their arts &amp;amp; film/media departments. The school in turn asked us to allocate the funds for them being that we&amp;#39;re now heading those classes in their school. The scary part is that as u may know, government grants tend to expire, and so we received this news with 3 DAYS TO SPARE ! We had to crack open the catalogs and get to ordering pronto.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  All of this came just a few days after the school received another grant. How crazy is that! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;     My boss Martin Cheesborough or Mr. C. aka Cheesy as we call him , now call me &amp;amp; Ramon his 2 good luck charms.-lol My first month has been a blast. Hard work &amp;amp; triumph.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
