 <title>Summer activities at Egleston Y</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;br /&gt;
Thought I would update for the summer.  At the Egleston Square YMCA we are having a camp for the after school program children.  I am offering a Creative Writing curriculum that I wrote myself for about 6-10 kids; I included digital storytelling.  Basically this curriculum lets the kids explore different ways of telling a story.  We will write poetry, short stories, fiction or non-fiction, since they are kind of young the short stories will be more like picture books.  Then we will do the digital stories.  I am thinking about just having the while group do one digital story because it might be a little too much for each person to do their own.  What do you think? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for the school age kids i will start a math club.  I have been collecting math resources and websites in our delicious website. I have a lot of colorful math games to do and work sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Teen Center I am providing a 6 week Media Literacy workshop called Media Minds, established through the YWCA.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Open Access at the computer lab is getting a slow start, but there is one lady that comes in who wants to have computer lessons, so i teach her Excel and basic computer skills.&lt;br /&gt;
So, lots of educational goodness and fun is happening this summer!&lt;/p&gt;
