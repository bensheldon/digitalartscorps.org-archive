 <title>Project Hope&#039;s Open House</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/194</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/ctcvistaqueen/267772114/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/109/267772114_67df54c97e_m.jpg&quot; border=&quot;3&quot; alt=&quot;Project Hope Community Lab&quot; title=&quot;Project Hope Community Lab&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I was excited to attend a bit of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prohope.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Project Hope&lt;/a&gt; open house yesterday (&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bostonherald.com/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=161883&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Boston Herald article on Project Hope Open House&quot;&gt;the Mayor was even there!&lt;/a&gt;), at their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prohope.org/news_communitybuilding.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new community building&lt;/a&gt; on Dudley Street.  It&amp;#39;s the first &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; building in Roxbury and a vastly different space than their building on Magnolia St (which is a former residence of nuns), where they crowded both their residential and education programs into one building.  Here&amp;#39;s the blurb from their press release on the new building: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The building, constructed with recycled materials and designed to be &amp;quot;earth-friendly&amp;quot; through its use of low-energy elevators and natural light, is fully equipped with two state-of-the-art computer centers, a spacious community room with a projection screen, a number of sizeable classrooms and administrative offices with outstanding views of Boston&amp;#39;s skyline. The new building stands as a symbol of hope for all clients that step through the glass doors and into the polished, professional lobby of Project Hope&amp;#39;s headquarters.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Char, a teacher at Project Hope, at a digital storytelling session I did at Umass Boston and she instantly got SO excited about the possibilities of bringing digital storytelling into their curriculum for adult literacy for low-income women.  She ended up recruiting Natasha Freidus from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.creativenarrations.net/site/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Creative Narrations&lt;/a&gt; to run a workshop with her teachers over the summer, and they created a story together about how they created a beautiful space for learning and sharing at the old building and their hopes to recreate it at the new building.  (I&amp;#39;m still nagging Char to get a copy of the finished story online...stay tuned.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the great folks at Project Hope have this lovely new Community Resource Lab in addition to a new lab upstairs for the literacy classes. I&amp;#39;m excited because now Char can incorporate more technology and digital storytelling into her curriculum.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/ctcvistaqueen/267771996/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/96/267771996_6cef331647_m.jpg&quot; border=&quot;3&quot; alt=&quot;Bird Apple&quot; title=&quot;Bird Apple&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On a personal note, I was highly amused by the intricate catering...even though I had to leave before I got to eat any of it... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
