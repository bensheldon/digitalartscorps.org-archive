 <title>It&#039;s been a long time</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, it&#039;s been a while since I last wrote so I thought now would be as good of a time as ever. So the biggest thing we&#039;re working on right now is getting funding. CTI (Community Technology Initiative) at the Collins Center is completly broke. As in we have zilch to our name, and the website (which may or may not be up) is coming out of my supervisor&#039;s pocket. Last week I helped put together my first ever grant, a Children&#039;s Trust Grant asking for a substantial amount. It was incredibly stressful, even though I had previously printed out all of the attachments. The whole thing was a huge headache/whirlwind that had us rushing to get the grant in 10 minutes before it was due (we made it somehow). Anyway I&#039;m doing everything in my power to make sure our next grant (due at the end of the week) doesn&#039;t end up like that. I want to make sure we&#039;ve all learned our lesson because I can&#039;t go through that again. That might be my most stressful experience. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
