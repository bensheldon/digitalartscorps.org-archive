 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &amp;#39;ve really missed writing to you guys. First let me say the new changes look good. It is also informative.  At the Pink House we are working on a Electronic post card for the children at the Center. They are simply wonderful. The children are in touch with children from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think there are enough hours in the day to do everything that is required to make things happen. The kids are totally great! The staff I&amp;#39;m working with totally open to the new changes we are putting in place. Oh yeah, we have a new Chief of Police and the community is totally excited about that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neighborhood awareness of what&amp;#39;s happening at the Pink House is making a name for us. The community comes to us with questions, comments, and participation in our projects. The electronic post cards are just one of the different techy things we have going on at the PINK HOUSE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well off I go to work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great Blogging with ya!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renae out&lt;/p&gt;
