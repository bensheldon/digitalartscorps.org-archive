 <description>&lt;p&gt;Paul Hansen, husband, artist and Director of the CTC VISTA Project, passed away on Monday night.  Paul&#039;s humor, optimism and vision will be greatly missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also set up a page on the CTC VISTA Website with links to some of Paul&#039;s work, art and influences (it is in progress and suggestions would be appreciated):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ctcvista.org/paul&quot; title=&quot;http://ctcvista.org/paul&quot;&gt;http://ctcvista.org/paul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul&#039;s passing has come as a great shock to all of us.  Nearly a year ago he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and despite that he has maintained a positive and ever-optimistic outlook.  At the CTC VISTA Project we have been forever changed by his presence, management and friendship and we hope to continue in his legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
