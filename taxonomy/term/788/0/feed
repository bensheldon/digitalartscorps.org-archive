 <description>&lt;p&gt;hello there ctc vista project.  things here at homeless prenatal are going right along-- i&#039;m unofficially the interim technology manager.  this means that i have been doing insane amounts of troubleshooting and teaching for both clients and staff.  in addition to managing the lab, i have also been working on creating policies and procedures, technology user guides and new website content as well as organizing the file server.  most of the guides are in the revisions process, so any suggestions for resources would be greatly appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;since my last post, i have had the opportunity to attend a couple of workshops including: one at the center for digital storytelling with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctcvista.org/user/968&quot;&gt;jessica&lt;/a&gt;, a drupal dream makeover course, an adobe interactive forms course and soon another photoshop course!  if you are interested, i can review and recommend (or not  recommend) the courses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; today i had lunch with the lovely &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctcvista.org/user/813&quot;&gt;morgan sully&lt;/a&gt; at my favorite little &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/biz/uGM7PAmP2utWXjYcZkVpQQ&quot;&gt;taco truck&lt;/a&gt; in the mission.  thank you $3 lunch. being with other vistas is quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;
