 <title>The Realities of Egleston YMCA</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1033</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been pretty busy at the Y this summer; camp for the child care program, the teen center slowly disintegrating, and the computer lab with all its wonderful programing happening.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer I facilitated two programs that were pretty successful.  We had a math club and a creative writing club and the kids seemed to love it!  This is one positive thing that came out of the summer.  Also, for the teen center, I hired a nice man to facilitate a media literacy workshop called Media Minds.  Non of the teens from the teen center became involved, which was very disappointing. But, this sort of thing is very new to Egleston, so it might take a couple of years to get people used to workshops like Media Minds.  What ended up happening was that we used teens that were working for the Y during the Summer to participate in the media literacy workshop and a few enjoyed it a lot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your probably wondering what I meant by the Realities of Egleston YMCA, well we got broken into and a lot of nice things got stolen from the computer lab! ) ; One monitor, all the speakers, and a digital camera, among others things in the building were stolen! My supervisor Matt Crichton says that these are the realities of this place and you work with what you got.  What do you think? Do you just work with what you have or do you fight and complain until things get right and you get what you want and in most cases what you need?&lt;/p&gt;
