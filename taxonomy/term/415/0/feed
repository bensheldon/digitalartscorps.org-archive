 <description>&lt;p&gt;At the CTC Conference Call last Friday, I was asked to do a brief presentation on web-conferencing tools.  Naturally, a presentation about web-conferencing tools deserves a presentation given on a web-conferencing tools, especially since the call consists of people literally all over the US.   Therefore, I set up an account on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vyew.com&quot;&gt;Vyew&lt;/a&gt;, and gave my presentation there.  You can still view the presentation (and its mishaps) if you go to Room 313064.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose Vyew primarily because it&amp;#39;s free and doesn&amp;#39;t require any downloads (other than a Flash plug-in for your browser).  We also didn&amp;#39;t require VOIP or any other fancy features.  It worked relatively well, for our purposes.  The call was part presentation, part experimentation.  Everyone was able to see the presentation, and seemed to have a good time exploring the features, especially the whiteboard.  This was somewhat problematic, in that I allowed everyone the ability to modify the presentation, which can be a bit distracting when the slide you&amp;#39;re talking about disappears.  At one point, I had to reload my powerpoint slide, so if you visit room on Vyew, you will see a very disjointed set of slides.  When I was done, the other VISTAs on the call had a good time with the whiteboard feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also attached is my original powerpoint slides, as well as my Excel file which contains a comparison of several web-conferencing tools, including a side-by-side comparison of their features and price.&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;
