 <title>The time has come to say goodbye...</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1209</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! This is my last blog entry as a CTC VISTA. It has been a very fun and rewarding year for me.  It all started when I moved to California from Philly. I still can&#039;t believe I up and left Philly and all my family and friends to move to a place where I had no permanent place to live, everything was totally unfamiliar, and where everyone (except for 1 person) was a stranger. I remember feeling so scared yet excited at the same time. I didn&#039;t know what to expect. My transition was rough not only for me but for my cat that I dragged along (sorry Meechie). I was fortunate to be temporarily housed by my co-worker and his wife for a month and then again for a few more months after my first roommate situation went bad. But then I ended up with a really cool and compatible roommate in June and both Meechie and I have felt at home ever since. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where did the time go? It feels like I&#039;ve only been here a few months. I guess time really does fly when you&#039;re having fun. I still feel so new to the Bay Area and have many more things to do, places to see, and cool people to meet. I have accomplished a lot in the last year though. I worked really hard creating and enhancing curriculum for the computer classes that we provide, I taught digital storytelling workshops to the Oakland youth, created a databases, refurbished computers, installed computer labs in schools and other organizations, and helped develop the website. We distributed over 2000 computers and installed about 1500 to schools in the year I served. I&#039;ve gained so much knowledge and experience from doing these things and it amazes me how far I&#039;ve come in one year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now my year as a VISTA has come to an end today. But I had a fitting ending to my year. I participating in an MLK day of service at Sobrante Park Elementary School. My organization, along with Hands on Bay Area and Kaiser Permanente Hospital, installed 50 computers in the school. I had a blast and I scored a really cool MLK day of service shirt (gotta love free stuff). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So tomorrow I will be an official OTX-West employee. I will be doing much of the same and then some. I feel like I did everything I set out to do and I&#039;m really proud of myself for that.  I really made a difference in the lives of many Oakland residents, in that my service was a step forward in eliminating the digital divide. But it doesn&#039;t stop here. There is still so much to do and so much room to grow. I&#039;m looking forward to what 2008 will bring and hope that it&#039;s as good to me as 2007. Good luck to you all and keep up the great work! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace out,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naomi&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>My Digital Story</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/893</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve started our digital storytelling workshops last week using Open Source software. The first group was from a boys juvenile detention camp. They were cool. They really got into their projects and enjoyed themselves in the process. This week we have a mixed group of kids ranging from 8 to 12 years old. I will post up some examples soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to share my digital story with you all. I created this story back in April when I went to the Digital Storytelling Center in Berkeley. I had the source files and I revised it a bit. You can check out my revised story at:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.otxwest.org/california_dreaming.html&quot; title=&quot;http://www.otxwest.org/california_dreaming.html&quot;&gt;http://www.otxwest.org/california_dreaming.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original is posted on the Stories For Change website.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://storiesforchange.net/node/352&quot; title=&quot;http://storiesforchange.net/node/352&quot;&gt;http://storiesforchange.net/node/352&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also check out the news report that was done on us last week. I&#039;m in the first and lost shots.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://cbs5.com/video/?id=23977@kpix.dayport.com&quot; title=&quot;http://cbs5.com/video/?id=23977@kpix.dayport.com&quot;&gt;http://cbs5.com/video/?id=23977@kpix.dayport.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that&#039;s it for me. Until next time...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naomi&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>My first class at OTX-West</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/756</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I taught my first class last week and it went great! I usually just teach the Internet section of the class but this time I taught the whole thing. Our classes at &lt;a href=&quot;http://otxwest.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OTX-West&lt;/a&gt; are 3 hours long and we teach basic computer training, Internet, and the OpenOffice programs Writer (similar to Word) and Impress (similar to PowerPoint). It was fun and the students and parents enjoyed it as well. I received great evaluations from them on my performance so that&amp;#39;s cool.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also went to a 3 day digital storytelling workshop at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.storycenter.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Center for Digital Storytelling&lt;/a&gt; in Berkeley a few weeks back. I created my first digital story and it  was fun. I went with my coworker Domingo to get some pointers on how to do these classes. Jessica, the VISTA at CDS, invited us to attend. My story was good but I ran out of time and didn&amp;#39;t get to do everything that I wanted.  I am editing my story on my own since I have all the files and I am even going to try to create the same story using Flash (which is going to be challenging since still learning the software) and OpenOffice Impress. It was a great experience and I want to thank Jessica and the Center for Digital Storytelling for having us. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Later,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naomi &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What I&#039;ve been up to</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/586</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been in California for a month and a half now and I love it! I found a place to live in Alameda which is just outside of Oakland where I work. Alameda is really nice and safe. I love my job and the people I work with are really cool! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been busy with a few projects at work. I developed an addition to their 3 hour Take Home Computer Class (THCP). This class provides Oakland students in grades 6-12 with basic computer training along with training on the Open Source software (OpenOffice, The Gimp, Audacity, typing tutors, anti-virus, anti-spyware, etc.) that we install on each computer. Once the students take the class,  then they receive a free refurbished computer with free life time tech support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made an OpenOffice Impress presentation (software similar and compatible to PowerPoint) that explains Dial-up, DSL, and Cable Internet service (Wireless discussion will be added soon). I developed this addition because I noticed that the instructors would always get a lot of questions about these types of Internet services. Students didn&amp;#39;t know the differences between them or how they worked, etc. I actually teach this portion of the class and explain in more detail about these technologies as I show them my presentation. My addition to the class is a success. The students and parents have a better understanding about how these technologies work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also been working on the new OTX-West website  (&lt;a href=&quot;http://otxwest.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;OTX-West&quot; class=&quot;links&quot;&gt;www.otxwest.org&lt;/a&gt;) using Dreamweaver. That&amp;#39;s a lot of fun. I&amp;#39;ve never used Dreamweaver before so I am getting some hands on experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;#39;ve been working with the director of curriculum on this summers digital storytelling workshop. We are in the process of revamping the curriculum and adding a web development part to it as well. I&amp;#39;m planing on going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.storycenter.org/index1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The Center for Digital Storytelling&quot; class=&quot;links&quot;&gt;The Center for Digital Story Telling &lt;/a&gt;in Berkeley, CA to see how they do their workshops and to get more information on how we can improve our workshop. There is a CTC VISTA working there already so I&amp;#39;ll be getting in touch with her soon.  I also have been learning the Open Source software that we use to create the digital stories (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gimp.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The Gimp&quot; class=&quot;links&quot;&gt;The Gimp&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://audacity.sourceforge.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Audacity&quot; class=&quot;links&quot;&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.audiograbber.com-us.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Audiograbber&quot; class=&quot;links&quot;&gt;Audiograbber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openoffice.org/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;OpenOffice&quot; class=&quot;links&quot;&gt;OpenOffice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nvu.com/index.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Nvu&quot;&gt;Nvu&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;#39;s it for now. I attached an OpenOffice Impress copy and PowerPoint compatible copy of my slide show. The PowerPoint copy may alter the formatting and animations that were used in the OpenOffice Impress version but you can get the jist of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Until next time....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naomi &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>This girl has landed!</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/412</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I flew to Oakland from the Boston PSO at 10:30 pm (I&amp;#39;m a Philly girl so that is 1:30 am my time) and was so tired yet filled with excitement. I can&amp;#39;t believe my cat and I made it in one piece! My supervisor from OTX-West (Oakland Technology Exchange) picked me up from the airport. I was missing one of my bags thanks to Delta but that didn&amp;#39;t bother me because I was in Cali! My supervisor took me to my co-workers house in Alameda where I would be staying until I find a place. Him and his wife are really cool folks. They&amp;#39;ve never met me but they offered their home to me. We sat back and talked, ate expensive cheese and drank some wine (now that&amp;#39;s my kind of greeting). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning, I went with my co-working to OTX-West to get a tour of the site and sit in on the computer literacy class that he was teaching. This place is awesome! They have done so much already to help bridge the digital divide in Oakland. I&amp;#39;m really glad I&amp;#39;m a part of their team  I checked out my desk and it is cool. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever had a desk before so I&amp;quot;m excited to have one. I can&amp;#39;t wait to start on Monday! , I look forward to my year of service and helping OTX-West better server the people of Oakland. Later....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Naomi&lt;/p&gt;
