 <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been awhile since I&amp;#39;ve done the blog thing.... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My progress with starting a youth channel and youth media program at my access center:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;slow.   slow.  and lacking direction.   Though on the bright side, i&amp;#39;ve got good resources, there are several kids interested, some organizations interested in partnering, and promised youth programming on the way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, I made a list of most of the youth media programs/access centers with youth programs from around the country.  If anyone wants that list, let me know.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contacted individuals from several organizations and recieved some replys.  I contacted Appalshop - (super media program and art collective in Appalachia, I think Eastern Kentucky) - and had a phone meeting with the woman who runs their youth media program  (Appalachian Media Insititute).   She gave some great advice for starting a program -  you can&amp;#39;t be everything.   Geez oh peet that seems so obvious.  Here I am, being ideailistic about all the great things a youth media program can do and trying to encororate everything.   So I&amp;#39;m working on hashing out some goals, hopeful outcomes and trying to determine the purpose of this youth media channel venture.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for getting content - that&amp;#39;s been another challenge.  At media bridges we&amp;#39;ve got some cute things the summer media camp kids made.  And we&amp;#39;ve got some Media that Matters Film Fest films to play.   I&amp;#39;ve contacted a few organizations to ask for content and nothing too concrete yet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plus side - I went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.archive.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;archive.org&quot;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;  (super super super site) and they have a youth media section including BAVC and ListenUp!   I found a pleasant lil claymation bit called &amp;quot;Pizza Math.&amp;quot;  I contacted the organization who made it, and they&amp;#39;ll be sending me a free dvd of their work!  yay!   success!   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s going, it&amp;#39;s going.  Like pudding down a slide.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope didin&amp;#39;t come off as sounding defeated and all that - I love it here.  Go community media!    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ps - for any talking heads fans out there, i just heard two great covers - the arcade fire doing home and built to spill covering dream operator from true stories.  find it !  &lt;/p&gt;
