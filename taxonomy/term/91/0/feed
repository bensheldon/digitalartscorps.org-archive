 <title>contact info and stuff</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/101</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I put together an Address Book card with everybody&amp;#39;s name, company, and e-mail address, (from the VISTA Roster that we all got). I thought that I could distribute this, and it would make it a lot easier for everybody to contact each other.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I would like to do now is come up with a good way for everybody to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) update and distribute the vCard files (when changes are made to their info), and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) distribute thumbnail headshots of everybody (to attach to their info cards), for that those of us who are terrible at remembering names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is something that nobody else is interested in, but I would very much like to have up-to-date contact cards, and little pictures, of all of the CTC VISTAs. So if any of y&amp;#39;alls have suggestions, or better ideas, let me know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
