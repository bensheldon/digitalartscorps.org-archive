 <title>New Beginning</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/72</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Glazing over at most of the discussions due to the fact that they are very tech specific, and I am not.  I am fundraising and marketing for my organization and have no clue regarding computer parts, software, etc.  My idea of computer maintenance and upkeep is taking it to my computer repair guys and saying &amp;quot;here - fix it&amp;quot; and they do.  I don&amp;#39;t know what they do, how they do it and prefer to keep it that way.  I am not a computer tech minded person, I come from a strong social work background and not technological, but this is a new beginning and I have much to learn.  I guess I will have to learn how to &amp;quot;glaze over&amp;quot; less.&lt;/p&gt;
