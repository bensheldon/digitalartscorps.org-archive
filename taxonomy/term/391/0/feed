 <title>Youth Development</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips for Teaching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many methods and approaches but the ones that work best are youth-centered and hands-on. On subsequent pages are several methods and approaches for planning and getting started with your DAY program, including project-based learning, portfolios, after school and in-school activities. Also, creating the space (DAY studio) is important, as well as developing the actual activities for your program. Upon request are some great lessons for teaching digital art (on CD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Art   Youth Program (DAY) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, three community-based technology centers across the country launched &amp;quot;ArtTech&amp;quot;, a five-week summer program that introduced youth to multimedia. Soon after the project was renamed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dayprogram.net/&quot;&gt;Digital     Art Youth Program&lt;/a&gt; or DAY. &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:nettrice@gmail.com&quot;&gt;Nettrice Gaskins&lt;/a&gt; created a resource guide for practitioners that was made available upon request. She also ran a local DAY program at the Boston Neighborhood Network from 2001-2004, with the help of an AmeriCorps VISTA (Derek Hixon). The Boston program served nearly a hundred local youth between the ages of 13 and 18. Additionally, Nettrice worked with a public high school in Dorchester to create school-based curriculum for teachers and students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating the DAY resource guide has been a labor of love for Nettrice (she did not profit from it). For more information about the guide visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dayprogram.net/&quot;&gt;DAY     web site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer Animation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Nettrice taught three computer animation classes at the Massachusetts College of Art. Two of the classes were for 12-18 year olds and the other was for high school students. For these classes Nettrice developed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://babel.massart.edu/%7Enettrice/&quot;&gt;web     site&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://babel.massart.edu/%7Enettrice/stuff_page.html&quot;&gt;curriculum&lt;/a&gt;. The activities   culminated in a CD/DVD and screening of youth work.   The work can also be seen on the web here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://portal.nettrice.us/bm/&quot;&gt;Digital     Media Channel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youth Entrepreneurship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia &lt;/a&gt;defines &lt;strong&gt;entrepreneurship&lt;/strong&gt; as &amp;quot;the practice of starting new &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization&quot; title=&quot;Organization&quot;&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt;, particularly new &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business&quot; title=&quot;Business&quot;&gt;businesses&lt;/a&gt; generally in response to identified opportunities.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nfte.com/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship&lt;/a&gt; have the mission &amp;quot;to teach entrepreneurship to young people from low-income communities to enhance their economic productivity by improving their business, academic and life skills.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of CTC VISTA Project&amp;#39;s participants, &lt;a href=&quot;http://yes-inc.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; The Young Entrepreneurs Society&lt;/a&gt; (YES), has a mission of &amp;quot;North Quabbin/Franklin County youth unlocking their potential through entrepreneurship, job readiness, financial and technology education and action&amp;quot; and does so with programs such as a buisness center, cyber cafe, and social service marketing projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What other projects or ideas are floating around about entrepreneurship?  Here&amp;#39;s a place to start! &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>40 Developmental Assets</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/460</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.search-institute.org/assets/40AssetsList.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.search-institute.org/assets/40AssetsList.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great link for anyone working with youth.  It&amp;#39;s a list of 40 Developmental Assets as compiled by the Search Institute... you can check out their site for other youth surveys, studies, and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like I&amp;#39;ll be learning how to use Audacity to do some music editing with charter high school students in Middleton, I&amp;#39;m excited to learn more about it! &lt;/p&gt;
