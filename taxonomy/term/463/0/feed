 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/375</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;as a vista in the city i am alway looking out for free and interesting events.  the public library in san francisco is pretty amazing at showing free films a couple of times per month and last night i had the pleasure of checking out the awesome documentary by Byron Hurt entitled &amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itvs.org/outreach/hiphop/&quot;&gt;Hip-Hop: Beyond Beats and Rhymes.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;  The documentary take as in-depth look at masculinity, misogyny, violence and homophobia within mainstream hip hop music and culture.  although i thought the analysis could have run a bit deeper, the film makes a point to trace the interconnections of white supremacy, racism, homophobia, sexism and capitalism.  and not only that, there are appearances by 50cent, mos def, fat joe and a bunch of other famous artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the screening was sponsored by a bunch of youth media production companies in the bay area and many of the audience members were youth affiliated with the said organizations.   the film is showing on pbs, tuesday, february 20th so check your local listings.  i know that there are screenings of the film around the country. a five minute cut of the documentary is also on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjxjZe3RhIo&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;check it out and happy hump day.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
