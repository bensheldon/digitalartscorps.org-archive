 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/186</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well lets see, I&amp;#39;ts been a while since my last entry and I should be better at this but hey what you gonna do.  Anyway Im working on a new project as well as the other two, I&amp;#39;ts called Citizen Schools and is an excellent program for youth,  It Takes locale People who want to teach what they do and puts them in a classroom to pass on what they know. As for the other projects we are comming along nicely. We have set up numerouse meetings with clients and I&amp;#39;ve started to find some potential Mentors. I think that catches us up to date. So if you got any questions please let me know and I will see you all next month here.&lt;/p&gt;
