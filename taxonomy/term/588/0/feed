 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m back on the blog tip. We didn&amp;#39;t have the net for a few weeks due to some funding issues. I had my own funding issues and I&amp;#39;m holding on with my finger tips, but its all good!   We are in full effect at Jordan high located in Watts and I&amp;#39;m proud to be apart of such a life transforming project.  The kids are really picking up video production fast and Ill post some of the project&amp;#39;s as soon as they are done.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I picked up a donated computer which will be used for a community information Kiosk.  I&amp;#39;m still in the process of creating some content for the Kiosk. It will be information that will help serve the community here... you know ...health issues, where to find help and government services, local sports and the finished video projects from the students in the program. we gettin it crackin (done, for those who don&amp;#39; speak..you know) LOL&lt;/p&gt;
