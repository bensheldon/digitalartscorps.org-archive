 <title>When &quot;Benefits&quot; aren&#039;t enough</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/656</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Anyone out there have one of those pesky &amp;quot;pre-existing conditions&amp;quot; that our benefits prefer not to cover? Well, I did, and it was time to fulfill a prescription (for a measly, oh, $150!) so it came time to find some alternatives! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my doctor turned me on to a &amp;quot;patient assistance&amp;quot; program. Basically, I searched online for the website of the company that manufactures the medication I needed and then sent them an email explaining my financial situation. I received a reply the next day complete with information on patient assistance programs and an application to be completed by my doctor and myself. A completed application, attached tax forms and a month of waiting later and I am happy to say I received a little medical card from the company giving me my prescription for FREE! Booyah! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps anyone out there who might have a similar issue. Good luck! &lt;/p&gt;
