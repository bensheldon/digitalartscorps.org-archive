 <title>I&#039;m in for 3 more months : )</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1518</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hola hola mundo! We have had weird weather in June so far here in Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just finished mailing out hundreds of Wired for Wireless Reports. Thanks Stephen for shooting that email, by the way! I am continuing to send out reports. This brings me to the database. Bounced mailed reports are actually in our favor because it helps to clean the database.  And so now, updating the database is of primary focus as well as using GIS tools (most likely Google Maps/Earth) to map out our network.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I helped organize California Emerging Technology Fund’s (CETF) very first webcast of a new campaign they launched for Southern California titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://getconnectedtoday.com/&quot;&gt;Get Connected: Your Life Made Easier&lt;/a&gt;.  Thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bresee.org/&quot;&gt;Bresee Foundation&lt;/a&gt; who actually brought out the equipment for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justin.tv/clip/654017a18088b9e6&quot;&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I recently got a CTC VISTA extension for about three months.  I am blessed to get the extension. I enjoy working here, and there are still a few things I need to get done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be the last month a few of you will be posting. I thank you for your help and your service…I am sounding like the president, jeje. Please stay in (Twitter) touch: @OsoHormiguero.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Kogi Korean BBQ Taco Trucks</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;The days of ArcGIS are over. I found out when I realized the computer labs at UC Irvine didn’t have the program, instead, they had Google Earth. Now, I have endlessly been working on updating our database of contacts the past couple of months, however, there really hasn’t been an end goal that has motivated to get that job done. But in the month of February, I have found that end goal: mapping out our constituents/network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a more serious note, some are still questioning how the U.S. should use $8 billion from the Stimulus Plan to expand broadband to low income and rural communities; listen to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100739283&quot;&gt;NPR Story&lt;/a&gt;. So in order to answer some of those queries, I will be working on a new podcast series titled &lt;em&gt;Why Broadband?&lt;/em&gt;  With this series I hope to cover how community based organizations or community technology centers use technology for the betterment of their community (i.e. economic development, community building, human development).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will start looking for housing after my lease ends. My lease ends in June and since the program ends in mid July, I have to find a place where I can stay for about two weeks. I am not too worried because my church is awesome! I actually stopped using my foodstamps, partly because my five church brothers/roommates have been sharing their food with me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will begin job searching this week. Reapplying to CTC VISTA at a different site in L.A./Orange County is still an option I am currently considering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I restarted using Twitter to try to accumulate California state tech news information. But in reality, I restarted after I read an article in the L.A. Time about a Twitter Cult that followed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/features/printedition/food/la-fo-kogi11-2009feb11,0,3007869.story. &quot; title=&quot;Kogi Korean BBQ Taco Trucks&quot;&gt;Kogi Korean BBQ Taco Trucks&lt;/a&gt; all around L.A. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing, I still haven’t registered for NTEN Conference, but I hope to do so soon.  I will keep you updated.&lt;/p&gt;
