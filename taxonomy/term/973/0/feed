 <title>The Life I Actually Want to Live</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1354</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Have any of you read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qwantz.com&quot;&gt;Dinosaur Comics&lt;/a&gt;? I&#039;m not totally in love with it, but sometimes it includes very perceptive insights. It&#039;s a daily webcomic that uses the same six frames of a goofy looking dinosaur every day to tell strange and goofy stories. The other day it ended with T-Rex saying &quot;Um, I&#039;m thinking... that a lot of my internal conflict and malaise comes from the tension between the life I ACTUALLY want to live, and the stories I want to be able to tell?&quot; I&#039;ve been thinking about that a lot lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should say, before going any further, that I&#039;m really happy with my life right now. I love working with the OLLIE program. I had a moment a couple weeks ago where I was setting up for a class and thought &quot;Is this really my job? I don&#039;t have to go back to nannying next week?&quot; I feel this way all the time- just so privileged to be part of this awesome program, doing such awesome things. I&#039;m taking Spanish classes, I&#039;ve visited the KBOO Youth Collective a couple of times to learn more about how their program runs, I meet awesome kids and teach them awesome things. This is the first job I&#039;ve ever had where I don&#039;t feel like anyone is questioning my intelligence or my ability. I can do this and I&#039;m good at it! And I think I&#039;m getting better every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to that dinosaur comic. Last night I talked to my best friend. She has lived a very adventurous life since we graduated college. Her primary jobs have been working as a pedicab driver and operating a puppet show on a bike. She&#039;s in several bands, went to Morocco last year, and just came back from a tour of England. I love her to death, and at time find myself very jealous of the excitement she fills her life with. I want to be able to tell stories about sailing up Lake Michigan on a tall ship, too! Or do I? Because, ultimately, I think I prefer this quiet existence I have carved out for myself. I want to be able to tell those stories, but I think this is really the kind of life I want to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started back in July, I was really worried about having enough personal time. It&#039;s somewhat of an issue, but in a lot of ways, something I&#039;ve always suspected has proved true: Having a job I like and care about takes away the need to fill my life with other things. I&#039;ve spent the previous four years working jobs that I don&#039;t care about to get by, and so I squeezed the most fun and enjoyment I could out of my free time, making art, dancing, and hanging out with my friends. It&#039;s not that I&#039;ve stopped doing these things, but I certainly don&#039;t have as much time for it now... But I don&#039;t miss it too much. Life is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, I just order three new pairs of glasses from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zennioptical.com&quot;&gt;Zenni Optical&lt;/a&gt;. You can get a pair for as cheap as $8! If you are an eyeglass wearer and have your prescription, this is a great deal. Especially since Americorps don&#039;t get vision insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
