 <title>Teeth and Ants</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/266</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I became a Vista, I naively hoped that the health benefits provided to us would include dental care. Thus, I put off getting my teeth cleaned and checked until when I thought my time of lacking insurance would be over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I haven&#039;t been to the dentist in a while, so when I recently read an article called &lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Insurance/InsureYourHealth/AsurvivalGuideForTheUninsured.aspx&quot;&gt;A survival guide for the uninsured&lt;/a&gt; (containing such cheerful news as &quot;The more than 45 million Americans without coverage will get sick more, earn less and die earlier than those with insurance&quot;) the best piece of info I got from it was the idea to try to find cheap dental care at dental schools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d heard of people doing that before but hadn&#039;t occurred to me lately. It seemed like a good plan. Unfortunately, apparently lots of others think so too. The only dental school in my state takes new patients through a long process which involves being selected through a monthly lottery, being screened via form answers to see if there is a current educational need for you, being placed on a waiting list for up to 6 months, and finally being given a screening appointment to see if they want to work with you. All that for low-cost dental care with people who aren&#039;t even dentists yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe you&#039;ll have better luck - here&#039;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/HealthInformation/FindingDentalCare/DentalSchools.htm&quot;&gt;list of dental schools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, my office has ants. They seem to have formed a colony or something in my trash can. Maybe this&#039;ll teach me to take out the trash more than never.&lt;/p&gt;
