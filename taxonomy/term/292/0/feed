 <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s see.....what&amp;#39;s new?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, my foodstamps finally kicked in, which I was so excited about that I blew nearly the entire amount in one monster shopping trip.  I even went so far as to purchase some smoked sausage for breakfast, which I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve had in 10 years.  And I&amp;#39;m not talking about those crappy little sausage links that look all gray and shriveled.  I&amp;#39;m talking &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; sausage.  Made from magical pig aristocrats, from the pig Social Register.  So that&amp;#39;s pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; My job finally started getting interesting.  I&amp;#39;ve gone to a good number of schools and after-school programs and youth programs now.  I&amp;#39;ve worked with everybody from 6th graders to 19-year-old homeless kids.  And the movies that the kids are making have been turning out really well.  Maybe I&amp;#39;ll post some examples when we get them completed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my free time, I am not dating.  That is because I have no time or money for girls. So if somebody knows of a resource where I can meet girls who are both fast and cheap, please let me know.                    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that was a joke.  And yes, it was funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to my lack of funds, I have had to come up with cheap forms of entertainment.  One of these has been to start a band.  This has been a lot of fun, and not as expensive as one might think.  For instance, I have plans to build an electric guitar out of a cigar box.  And I checked out a video from the library called &amp;quot;How To Make Your Own Musical Instruments&amp;quot;.  I am building a tub bass, a mouth bow, and a dulcimer.  If anybody else wants to start a band on the cheap, let me know.  Perhaps we could collaborate on a cross-country song of some kind (which is exactly what my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.publicparasites.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;SunTribe&lt;/a&gt; blog is intended for).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also started a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kirstenacademy.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;continued education&lt;/a&gt; program, with the help of a few friends.  It&amp;#39;s a good way to learn new things, hang out with friends, meet new people, and have fun on the cheap.  If anybody has any questions about that, or would like to start their own satellite KirstenAcademy, please let me know.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, that&amp;#39;s it for now.  Catch ya on the flipside.&lt;/p&gt;
