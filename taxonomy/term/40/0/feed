 <description>&lt;p&gt;Accessibility or more specifically &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/WAI/&quot;&gt;web accessibility&lt;/a&gt; encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities. Millions of people have disabilities that affect their use of the Web. Currently most web sites and web software have accessibility barriers that make it difficult or impossible for many people with disabilities to use the Web. As more accessible web sites and software become available, people with disabilities are able to use and contribute to the Web more effectively. Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities. For example, a key principle of web accessibility is designing web sites and software that are flexible to meet different user needs, preferences, and situations. This flexibility also benefits people without disabilities in certain situations, such as people using a slow Internet connection, people with temporary disabilities such as a broken arm, and people with changing abilities due to aging.The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. An accessible Web can also help people with disabilities more actively participate in society. Being apart of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista&quot;&gt;CTC VISTA Project&lt;/a&gt; you&amp;#39;re guaranteed to be working with all different types of people, including people with disabilities. Whether it updating your organizations website so it meets &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.section508.gov/&quot;&gt;Section 508&lt;/a&gt; standards, making an after-school programs curriculum accessible for students with learning or physical disabilities, or installing accessible computer applications, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_products/software_jaws45newfea.asp&quot;&gt;JAWS&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nuance.com/naturallyspeaking/&quot;&gt;Dragon Naturally Speaking&lt;/a&gt;, onto your computer technology centers computers. All of these things are important in maintaining equal access and opportunity for everyone in the community that you are serving.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Chicago:  You&#039;re Stuck Here</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1237</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The big story of the week is that I was supposed to speak at a conference in Ocean City, MD about free and low-cost tools for nonprofits.  Unfortunately (or fortunately), I live in &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicago and weather conditions made it impossible to fly out in time to give the talk.  Nuts!  Then again, who wants to go to Ocean City in February?  My next trip is scheduled later next month--which starts tomorrow--for the NTEN Conference in New Orleans.  If anybody is getting there on Wednesday, I suggest you go to the NTEN Science Fair if for nothing else than to see the exhibits and take place in the raffle.  I got an email from them and it looks like they&#039;re giving out a million iPods, but don&#039;t quote me on that figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of New Orleans, does anybody need a room(mate)?  My organization, Grassroots.org, has put me up at the Sheraton (where the conference is being held), but I&#039;m staying in a double and would like to save some money for them if I can.  If anybody&#039;s interested in splitting the room, email me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:karl@grassroots.org&quot;&gt;karl@grassroots.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, does anybody know about good resources for website accessibility?  I&#039;m supposed to be researching it in preparation for making our site more accessible, but I&#039;m finding guides that might be more trouble than they&#039;re worth.  Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I had a good experience the other day with regards to my position.  My roommate was wondering who Grassroots.org gave its services to.  I told her that we typically give our services to nonprofits (especially 501c3s).   She then told me that her family had just applied for nonprofit status for an organization that centers around her cousin and the rare medical condition that he has.  They were looking to make a website for the organization.  &quot;Sure,&quot; I said, &quot;We can get you that.&quot;  Yeah, I&#039;m cool.  I work at a nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;

Mouseless browsing bases on appending small boxes with unique ids for all links, form elements and frames to the page. You can trigger an action (e.g. following the link) by simply entering the id and depending on the configuration confirming it by pressing Enter.  Used in conjunction with voice recognition software, you can visit links by simply speaking a number. - for Macintosh see;&lt;br /&gt;
