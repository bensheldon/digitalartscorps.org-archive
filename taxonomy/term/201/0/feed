 <title>Forebearance/Deferment</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/197</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else been having trouble with their forebearance requests for student loans? Mine was rejected becaue my loan is not a federal loan. I don&amp;#39;t really know what else to do. I asked about a deferment but was told that because my parents co-signed they would be forced to pay while I was serving this year if I was unable to pay which obviously is not something I want to happen. Help!&lt;/p&gt;
