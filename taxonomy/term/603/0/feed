 <description>&lt;p&gt;hi there.  Spring is in the air here!  And it&amp;#39;s already humid.   Everything at Media Bridges is going alright.  Though our state senate just introduced a devastating bill to public access, consumer choice and all that stuff.  Am I allowed to talk about that?  well, anyways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I finished a mini grant for a summer media camp.  It was a short short grant but good experience to write up descriptions and form some budgets.  By the way, if you are writing a grant, you&amp;#39;re a volunteer, not a staff person and that looks really nice to the grant people.  We&amp;#39;ll do the camp regardless if we get the money, since it&amp;#39;s already in the budget, but more money is always nice for equipment and foooooood.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started an outreach with an afterschool youth center last week.  Nice kids and they love love love the camera.  Everyone wants to be on camera.  Yesterday, after finishing filming the footage for the movie about the center, the group of kids broke out into an impromptu rap.  With beats, background vocals and raps and all.  I think we&amp;#39;ll add that footage during the credits.  They&amp;#39;ve been more excited about the extra footage and getting bloopers than the actual content.  Go figure.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another group I&amp;#39;m working with decided that they want to make a documentary about motorcycles.  Several of their teachers have motorcycles (I think most of them are former NFL players, no kidding, it&amp;#39;s a great high school football school).  They also plan on getting some motorcycle &amp;#39;cliques&amp;#39; to do tricks but we&amp;#39;ll see if that happens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I&amp;#39;ve also been working on writing our youth media program policies, particularly our internship policies.  I actually had an intern under me for a few months, but that all went sour.  Part of the problem was that I never laid the boundaries or explained even the hierarchy of our organization.  Good learning experience though it was a nightmare as it was happening.  I hope these policies and guidelines will prevent future problems.  And if anybody has any suggestions or their org has some written intern policies, please help.Â    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that should do it.   Oh - and thanks to karl for the badass bike website.  I&amp;#39;m planning to start biking to work and based on that map, the elevation and the calories burned, i think i can drop my ywca membership (which i never use anyways).  super.   &lt;/p&gt;
