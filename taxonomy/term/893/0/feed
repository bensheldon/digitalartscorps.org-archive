 <title>BONUS Field Report: How to Stay Financially Stress-free On a VISTA Budget</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1243</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ctcvista.org/files/MonthlyBudget.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
Hello There VISTAs,
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As a special BONUS Field Report, I decided to write about some money management tools/tips I came across recently.  As a VISTA, money can be tight.  If mismanaged, then money can be REALLY tight.   If you&#039;re like me, than you were probably used to subsisting at a certain standard of living before becoming a VISTA (or not).  You&#039;re suddenly having to figure out other ways to get to work, find the best deals on food and sacrifice things you thought you&#039;d never live without. Having to reorganize your spending and budgeting habits can be pretty stressful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
However, the transition in to VISTAhood doesn&#039;t have to be as traumatic or hard on you financially, provided that you use your new found poverty (or stable paycheck!) as an opportunity to develop a strong spending and budgeting regimen.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
In this field report, I&#039;ll give a brief overview of an automated &lt;em&gt;Monthly Budget Calculator&lt;/em&gt; (attached at the end of this report) I&#039;ll also share with you the awesomeness of &lt;em&gt;stress-free bank account automation&lt;/em&gt; - a nice little series of hacks to take the stress out of paying your monthly bills, build your savings and STILL have a little left over for that *Deluxe* bowl of Top Ramen.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Your Budget&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
Part of staying stress free during times of financial hardship is having a clear understanding of your financial obligations and limitations.  It&#039;s also nice to know where you might a have a little more &#039;wiggle room&#039; for those enticing moments (or unexpected expenses) that inevitably come along the way during these times.&lt;br /&gt;
Included at the end of this report is a *Monthly Budget Calculator.  You will notice 4 columns in it: Income, Fixed Expenses, Variable Expenses and Totals.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Income&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
In this column, there are two sub columns.  One is simply for labeling your income source(s) - my hope is that you take this calculator with you where ever you may go.  I&#039;ve conveniently entered in &#039;AmeriCorps Stipend&#039; for you as well as the monthly income ($800) for a VISTA serving in San Diego - this may be different dependent on the city and state you are serving in.  You can change the $800 amount to fit what ever yours is.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fixed Expense&lt;/em&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
Here is where you will list each of your fixed expenses and other monthly bills, like &#039;Rent&#039;, &#039;Savings&#039;, and &#039;Cell phone&#039;.  I&#039;ve entered in some &#039;filler&#039; numbers for these - change to fit your situation.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variable Expenses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
These are expenses that can vary by month.  Food is sometimes the most variable of these which can be either a good thing or bad thing (do let your supervisor or VISTA Leader know if you are running low on food - they&#039;re there to help and there are plenty of resources out there).  Transportation is another one, like if you decide to bike to work one day instead of taking the bus or you end up carpooling.  I usually try to round this up a bit, just in case - any extra left over can either go to my savings or for some extra &#039;discretionary income&#039; (see below).
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Totals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
Here is where all the magic happens.  If you&#039;ve been changing the numbers around in the other parts of the spreadsheet, you may have noticed that the numbers here change AUTOMATICALLY to reflect the changes you&#039;ve made.  Immediately, you can see where your money is going, the total of your expenditures as well as any &#039;Discretionary Income&#039; you may have left over.  This is income you can use as you wish: a visit to the book store,  the movies or maybe even partially back in to your savings - savings are after all, an investment in your future.&lt;br /&gt;
Now that you&#039;ve got a tool and framework for understanding what your monthly budget is, where your expenses are going and even how much &#039;extra&#039; money you have available, the next step is to ensure that the right money goes to the right places and that you can do this all on time  -  without stressing.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
Think you can&#039;t do it?  Read on.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Getting Bills Paid On Time = Less Stress = Happy VISTA&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
A major cause of financial stress is bills.  Well, not necessarily the bills them selves, but having to PAY them - especially if there is some unexpected expense that comes up during your VISTA year.  While you can&#039;t do away with these completely,  there are a few things you can do to be in strong financial standing.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hack Your Bank: Automating Multiple Checking Accounts are Key to Avoiding Financial Stress&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
An oft over-loooked fact about most checking accounts is that you can set up &lt;em&gt;automatic withdrawals and deposits&lt;/em&gt;.  You can divide and disperse deposits made to your bank account across multiple checking/savings accounts, pay bills to specific utilities automatically and even mail checks - all by specific dates.  All of these can be further set up to occur on regular, repeating dates (which works nicely as your AmeriCorps stipend also occurs on a regular, repeating date - hint, hint).
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
You can also set up &lt;em&gt;multiple accounts&lt;/em&gt; to work in concert with your saving, checking and bill paying automation.  When you first got  your bank account, you most likely got a checking account and savings account.   Referring back to our Monthly Budget Calculator tool, you can also set up another checking account for &#039;Fixed Expenses&#039; - think of it as your specific &#039;bill paying&#039; account.  Used in conjunction with the automatic check dispersement of your VISTA Stipend deposit mentioned above, automatic bill payment from this new account takes the hassle out of writing and mailing a check or paying over the phone close to the time your bill is due. Just be sure the monthly amount in this account matches what you came up with previously in your Budget Calculator.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
Setting all this up is usually free, takes just a few minutes and can work wonders for reducing stress.&lt;br /&gt;
All this so you can enjoy the finer things in life, like whether to get &#039;Oriental&#039; flavor Top Ramen or &#039;Deluxe Oriental&#039; flavor Top Ramen.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
What are some other ways that YOU maximize and manage your VISTA Stipend?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This &#039;calculator&#039; is in Excel format (but you can open it in any program that read .xls files).  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>IPv6</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1171</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, long time no post. I was going to talk about one of the things I&#039;ve been working on, which is IPv6. This&#039;ll take a little bit of background explanation, so if you&#039;re already tech savvy and know all about IPv6 just bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably have at least some idea of how the Internet works. Virtually every computer or device connected to the Internet (or just about any computer network really) is assigned an address, known as an &quot;Internet Protocol&quot; (or IP) address. These IP addresses are usually represented by a string of four numbers between 0 and 255 separated by dots, like 74.134.239.209. Computers on a network send packets of information much like you or I would address a letter. The packet is addressed with the number of the computer that it wants to send the information to (like a web browser requesting a copy of a webpage) and sends the packet on its way. That packet makes its way to the target computer, which reads the information and puts it to whatever use was intended (like processing the correct webpage and sending it back to the web browser). Exciting, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version of the Internet Protocol that we use is known as version 4, and has been in use since 1981, and has worked well. However, we are in perilous danger of exhausting the total number of unique address numbers available. There are only 4,294,967,296 unique addresses available using the current standard. This might seem like a lot, but consider that it is not even close to as many addresses are there are people in the world (~6.5 billion). Now think of how many Internet-connected computers and devices there are in  the world, each of which possess one or more IP addresses. Furthermore, there are millions of those addresses which are reserved for special purposes, like private networks, multicasting, and other network-architecture related functions. So our available address space suddenly seems quite small. In fact, current estimates of address exhaustion place the time that we run our of unique addresses at sometime in the first half of the year 2010, at which point without a solution architectural growth of the Internet will come to a halt. This situation is what is known in technical terms as Not Good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter IPv6. IPv6 is the next version of the Internet Protocol (IPv5 was an experimental streaming protocol that was designed to complement IPv4 but was never used). In the words of Bill Nye, IPv6 is Really Bigly Hugely Big. The address space is so large (2^128 addresses) that it&#039;s difficult to even adequately describe, so I&#039;ll attempt to do so with a series of metaphors I found on Wikipedia and elsewhere. IPv6 has roughly 50 octillion addresses (a 5 with 28 zeros after it) for each person on Earth. If the population of the Earth were 18 quintillion, there would be about 18 quintillion addresses for each of them. If the IPv4 address space were the volume of an iPod, then the IPv6 space would be the size of the entire Earth. I especially like this one: there are a million times as many IPv6 addresses as there are IPv4 addresses...for each star in the known universe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you get the idea. IPv6 is big, and should last us for a while. It also solves a lot of problems that IPv4 has introduced. In order to stave-off address exhaustion, various network technologies have been introduced which break the end-to-end nature of the Internet. Originally, the intent was for the Internet to be the great non-hierarchical redundant network, with every single Internet-connected computer (or &quot;Host&quot;) with an unbroken two-way path to every other host. However, technologies like Network Address Translation (NAT) have been introduced which allow hosts to share &quot;public&quot; (visible to the rest of the Internet) addresses. This is why if you&#039;ve ever looked at the network settings on your laptop when you&#039;re out at a café or something, your address always seems to be 192.168.blah.blah or something similar (maybe 172.16.blah.blah). These are addresses set aside for &quot;private networks,&quot; which are networks which are never visible to the rest of the Internet. Probably the café only has one IP, which it shares with all of its clients. The end-to-end path is broken, because a set of hosts are behind a hierarchical structure made by NAT. Often there is a similar situation at home, where all clients of an ISP are behind the ISP&#039;s NAT. This makes it difficult if not impossible for you to publish content to the Internet without utilizing third-party services and websites, or paying ISPs extra money for &quot;business class&quot; services on top of what you pay for bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#039;s more, that one address is probably &quot;dynamic&quot; rather than &quot;static.&quot; That means that the café&#039;s Internet Service Provider (and probably your ISP at home) assigns an address to them dynamically from a common pool as they become available. Why is this a problem? Well, it&#039;s not, unless you want to provide content, like a website. A protocol called Domain Name Service (or DNS) assigns human readable addresses (like ctcvista.org) to IP addresses (like 208.113.151.31) based on a database of those pairings. If ctcvista.org had a dynamic address, then if the ISP decided to change it to 208.113.151.32, ctcvista.org would no longer point to the right place and no one would be able to find the website. This means that in order to have a website, people have to pay hosting providers for space on computers that have expensive static IPs that don&#039;t change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still with me? Okay, so IPv6 can solve these problems by assigning a public, static IP to every device on Earth. However, who gets to assign the addresses? Currently, all the IP addresses on Earth are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). IANA delegates that responsibility to organizations in charge of large geographical areas. So all of the addresses in North America are assigned by the American Registry of Internet Names and Numbers (ARIN). ARIN allocates ranges of IP address numbers called &quot;blocks&quot; to qualifying organizations, mainly large ISPs. This makes sense in a way, because ISPs provide the connectivity and it is architecturally simplest for the assigned numbers to reflect the actual structure of the networks that make up the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are a large number of community projects that require a large number of addresses but don&#039;t fit into the established model. These are projects like community networks, municipal wireless networks, community technology centers, and community-run ISPs. These groups are often short on cash but need a large number of addresses for all of their computers, devices, and members. But even though there are a huge number of addresses available, they still have to pay an arm and a leg to go through the large ISPs that maintain a stranglehold on the address space as if it were still running out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, finally, enter my organization, Acorn. Acorn is working with ARIN to do two things:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Get a large allocation of addresses that Acorn can then hand out to community projects that need them without them having to go through the big ISPs.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Change the policy so that in the future any other organization can do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number one is accomplished. Acorn&#039;s been awarded a /32 block, which is 2^92 addresses. Billions and billions, to say the least. Now we&#039;re working on a policy proposal for early next year which, if ratified, will set up a procedure for other community organizations to get their own IP addresses to provide services to the people in their neighborhoods without having to go through the ISPs for anything but connectivity. Hopefully with this work, we can make the Internet become a better, fairer place like it was intended to be before the critical date in 2010 before IPv4 runs out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I hope that this is a fairly straightforward explanation while still being accurate. I&#039;m far from being the world&#039;s foremost expert on Internet architecture, so if I got any points wrong feel free to correct me.&lt;/p&gt;
