 <title>Level up! &lt;plup&gt;</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1361</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Work has been picking up. We are in an interesting phase for Vertical Response (thanks Matt G. for the recommendation). I applied for those 10,000 free monthly email blasts and we got a response rather quickly. That built some momentum at CCTPG California Community Technology Policy Group), because afterwards I worked on a layout for our newsletter. I&#039;ve been working on our website&#039;s site map and wireframe using Microsoft Visio, ooooo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, about three weeks ago, I was able to make it to an event put on by the Pat Brown Institute of Public Affairs. The topic for discussion was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBf4D7210pY&quot; technology and the future of civic&gt;“Technology and the Future of Civic Engagement.” &lt;/a&gt; We met some interesting people at this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webinars: I hope to apply to the Drupal and the website securities webinar from NTEN. I think today is the deadline to apply for IST funds for the Drupal webinar, because the webinar will be put on exactly 2 weeks from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to the CTCnet Conference and seeing as many CTC VISTAS as possible. The three CCTPG staff have signed up for the conference (including me). So I hope to see you all soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On other Non-related work issues: it seems like my foodstamps are on hold. But I will try to clear that up as soon as I can. This past weekend, my brother and I went to Mexicali, Mexico for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiestasdelsol.com.mx/&quot; title=&quot;Las Fiestas del Sol&quot;&gt;Las Fiestas del Sol&lt;/a&gt; (it’s like a huge city fair). This means I have been able to save some money from my stipends (keep in mind I have no car and I live with 5 other people, jeje). So, I am thankful for CCTPG that they have been able to cover my transportation costs. I usually grocery shop after work or in the weekends, &lt;em&gt;todo a pie&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last fun one: Halloween costume: &lt;a href=&quot;http://theluchadores.blogspot.com/2007/07/octagon.html&quot; title=&quot;Octagon Mask&quot;&gt;Octagon Mask&lt;/a&gt; (only), which I bought while in Mexicali. Octagon was my favorite Mexican Luchador from the AAA league.&lt;/p&gt;
