 <title>First Day on the &quot;Job&quot;</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/112</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it seems most people have been at their postions for at least a week.  I just started today.  I&amp;#39;m working for &lt;a href=&quot;/www.aspirationtech.org&quot;&gt;Aspiration&lt;/a&gt; in downtown San Francisco, which is incredibly cool.  I got a nice computer and a nice workspace.  This morning Heather (my supervisor) went through all the tools I&amp;#39;ll be using, and I&amp;#39;m looking forward to getting my hands on them.  Gunner (my other supervisor) took everyone at Aspiration out to lunch (that&amp;#39;s easy when there&amp;#39;s only 3 people).  Right now they&amp;#39;re at a meeting, and I&amp;#39;ve been playing around with my computer and the &lt;a href=&quot;/socialsourcecommons.org&quot;&gt;Social Source Commons&lt;/a&gt; (which Gunner will show me more about when he gets back).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I spent moving.  First driving down to South Carolina where I gave my parents my car, and then flying to Oakland on Tuesday.  My furniture all arrived on Thursday, and my wife and I were completely unpacked and organized by Sunday (more or less).  We actually invited a few people over for a movie Sunday night as inspiration to us to get everything done. &lt;/p&gt;
