 <title>Week 2 of My Vista Year</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/967</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Week 2 of my VISTA year was more of the same from the first week.  I&#039;m still working on cleaning up the service listings for the counties on the 4People website.  While tedious, it&#039;s rewarding knowing that when people look at the county listings, they&#039;ll be more accurate with regard to the exterior links. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4people.org&quot; title=&quot;www.4people.org&quot;&gt;www.4people.org&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One nice thing is that much of the work is done by telecommuting.  Last week I went in to the office only two days: one to collect the mail, the other to discuss how the clean-up project was going.  Misty (the other Vista) collected the mail 2 other days.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a personal note, I found out my horse has laminitis.  It&#039;s a good thing I brought her home -- she had been put on pasture for too long, too soon (one of the causes of laminitis is too rich a diet, such as too much pasture right after being on hay only).  Now she&#039;s on dry lot and can&#039;t go onto the pasture all summer (bummer).  I have to find a source of hay since I can only buy so many bales from my neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&lt;/p&gt;
