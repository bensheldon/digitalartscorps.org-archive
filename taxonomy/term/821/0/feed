 <title>Learning what your made of...</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1012</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve completed over half of my VISTA year, and it has certainly been a challenge. While I&#039;ve enjoyed my position and the type of work I&#039;m doing I&#039;ve been facing a rather difficult dilemma. No matter how hard I work we all make the same amount. I know everyone struggles with the income a VISTA makes. So I know many of you are feeling the pinch. Working so hard and for many hours and having so little monetary reward is a slap in the face when you can&#039;t support yourself. This experience has defiantly made me a stronger person, but it has really tested what I&#039;m made of.&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ve also reached the point of questioning if the struggles are really worth the effort. And I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that I&#039;m not working a &quot;job&quot; but building a future career. Which will be much more rewarding in the long run. I&#039;m just wondering if other VISTA&#039;s face this dilemma as well? I know the people that we help appreciate the jobs we do.&lt;/p&gt;
