 <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to attend a workshop in Springfield, MA. yesterday (october 18) and was very impressed by the speaker.  The subject was guerrila marketing, and he was so fast and able to communicate key items in a very limited amount of time that before I knew it 2 hrs. had flown by.  I have to get sponsors for our newly launched website and I have never been &amp;quot;trained&amp;quot; in how to do that.  The workshop entitled &amp;quot;Intro to guerrilla marketing&amp;quot; was offered to the Massachusetts small business development center network by The Steady Sales Group/J. Sheldon Snodgrass of 89 South St. , Williamsburg MA 01096  and he was impressive in that he was so on point about the info given. There was hardly time for in depth interaction, but we came away with a workbook that we could do our own study with.  So glad to have been able to attend.  I&amp;#39;ve been a wee bit nervous about the cold calling I need to do, but my background of 40 yrs. as a hairdresser alllows me a certain amount of comfort because I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with the public for so long.  It&amp;#39;s always GOOD to get some further training anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I was invited to attend a luncheon given at a lovely &amp;quot;Log Cabin Banquet Hall and Meeting Place&amp;quot; in Holyoke, MA.  One of the graduates of the YES program was honored (as was the YES program) for having accomplished starting his own business, being gainfully employed, buying his own home ( at 23 yrs. old) and making good use of the training he received here.  What a nice event, and a most wonderful lunch.  Danielle, I made up for every free meal I&amp;#39;ve ever missed in Boston in the last 6 months!!!  The event was a 15 year annual meeting given by the Trustees of the Community Foundation of Western MA, an organization that funded our odd jobs program, and one of the many programs that Leon Howard ( our own celebrity guest of honor) was able to avail himself of while a youth in town. &lt;/p&gt;
