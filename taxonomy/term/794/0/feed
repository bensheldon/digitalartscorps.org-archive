 <title>Portland Speaks: The genesis of the idea</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1375</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://dennetmintoncorps.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/website_home-page.png?w=300&amp;amp;h=224&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;website_home page&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pcmtv.org/&quot;&gt;From July onward, I&#039;ve spent much of my time at Portland Community Media&lt;/a&gt; working on a proposal for a project that would allow immigrants and Millennials to create media at low-cost anywhere and at anytime. To do this, we focused on the cell phone as a media creation device and the Internet as the primary distribution platform with the hope of television as a second one. Here&#039;s how the idea began:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After coming back from Africa, I have a deeper appreciation for the immigrant experience. As a minority, I could only superficially understand the immigrant struggle till my experience as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peacecorps.gov/&quot;&gt;Peace Corps&lt;/a&gt; volunteer in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesotho&quot;&gt;Lesotho&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to this, there’s very little ethnic diversity in Portland, and I was curious why, out of the major West Coast cities, it had been excluded from the richness of cultural infusion.&lt;br /&gt;
My first day on the job as a CTC Vista, I had a talk with Jason, who managesthe government production side of PCM. I was asking about immigrant representation on PCM channels and programming done by immigrants, of which Jason said there was very little. We talked about the lack of outreach by PCM to immigrant communities in the area even though it’s in line with the mission, and we discussed the need for their presence in community media in Portland.&lt;br /&gt;
Having come from print journalism, I have a penchant for paper. Bea, my supervisor, shares this as a bookbinder. We discussed what would be the most comfortable and familiar medium for immigrants. Despite my position as the New Media Vista, I really wanted to bring print into PCM. We decided that, of all forms of media, paper is the most familiar in the world and probably the most comfortable form of communication that anyone can opt for.&lt;br /&gt;
Since I was hired on to be the New Media Vista without really understanding what the buzzword of “New Media” and “Web 2.0” were, I was also researching heavily during my first couple of weeks on the job. I read a lot about social media and also came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://mobileactive.org/&quot;&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt; focusing on the phone as an activist tool. It was incredibly interesting for me to learn how phones were being used for flash mobbing and information distribution in third world countries.&lt;br /&gt;
At the time, my boyfriend was also about to replace his shitty phone and was intently scouring the Internet for new cell phone technology and customer ratings. I asked him about transferring contacts, SMS’, and other forms of data from his old phone to a new one. I remembered how all my phones used to have a voice memo feature and the short amount of time it allowed for recording. I figured this was anywhere between 1-10 minutes because I used to accidentally hit the voice memo feature on my old cell phone while on calls. I realized how that might be a possibility for new media use for immigrants and thought it might be appropriate technology because of what I saw in Lesotho: Everyone has a cell phone regardless of how remote they are, and a lot of it is driven by the phone as a status symbol. &quot;Everyone&quot; is a bit of an exaggeration, but I later learned that the most familiar and bestselling communicative technology device in the world is the cell phone, which suggests that the phone is at least more familiar than other new communication media.&lt;br /&gt;
I started to test the technical side of this idea with phones that belonged to coworkers and friends. The goal was trying to figure out the average amount of time that the memo feature records, and that’s where I discovered that, in fact, not all phones have voice memo features, and phones range in recording time from a minute to whatever amount of memory is left on the phone.&lt;br /&gt;
It was around that time that Bea put Jacob and me together on a project to figure out how PCM could address the needs of both immigrant communities and Millennials. PCM has a very hard time retaining Millennials at the facility, and yet they are some of the most media active and social justice oriented people in Portland.&lt;br /&gt;
Eventually, I stumbled upon a social networking site called “Utterz,” (now known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.utterli.com/&quot;&gt;Utterli&lt;/a&gt;), and although the hope of the voice memo feature was zero-cost media creation, it seemed that a system like Utterli (people dial in to record memos and interviews) was the best compromise between cell phone plans and incongruencies in cell phone features. Utterli, however, is a free form social media site, and Portland Speaks has more of a focus in the form of target groups.&lt;br /&gt;
However, following a group brainstorm and dissection, Jacob and I felt &lt;img src=&quot;http://dennetmintoncorps.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/website_main-user-page.png?w=300&amp;amp;h=224&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;website_main user page&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;somewhat confused and disillusioned since our parameters were loose and our ideas were being scrambled, so I set out to define the original idea and it burgeoned into the attached proposal and illustrations. It was then decided that the idea would be submitted for the Knight Foundation&#039;s News Challenge grant (our application can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://generalapp.newschallenge.org/SNC/ViewItem.aspx?pguid=4a4f8c6a-d2c2-4545-82db-c8ed4b415eba&amp;amp;itemguid=e9c68308-afa1-4c6c-a991-b71a8c76c997&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
All in all, this has been an incredible learning process with lots of creativity but also some incredibly devastating downs. Welcome to the real world, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Secret universe?</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/982</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It is Friday afternoon, and I am about to conclude my first *official* week as a CTC*VISTA at Cambridge Community Television. To sum it up: I feel like I have been given the key to a secret door that leads to the land of 21st-century innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t mean that in a dorky way...really. (Judging by the listserv emails, I&#039;m quite the airhead compared to all you techies.) I just feel this is giving me a huge leg up over everyone else I graduated with 2 months ago. Ironically enough, I found out about CTC*VISTA through a job/internship opportunity newsletter of BU&#039;s College of Communication. It&#039;s ironic because I had never heard about CCTV at BU, even though it&#039;s located less than a mile away from the BU Bridge, offers full access to equipment, much more freedom to create content (as well as a larger viewership base than BUTV has), and classes that are simple to get into and teach you things like podcasting and HTML (while my multimedia class last semester merely taught me Microsoft FrontPage). I did hear about WGBH quite often, and it was through my internship there that I first heard about CCTV. The reason I am recalling this stuff is to emphasize what a turn of luck it was that brought me here. Ever since Penguin Day I&#039;ve been realizing more and more what a necessary component this VISTAship is in completing my media education in today&#039;s world. (And I&#039;m getting like $11,000 for it!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just read Meegan&#039;s comment about the Knight Foundation news challenge. I looked through the winners and saw organizations like Harvard and MIT...both involved in groundbreaking digital media projects, and both located around the corner from my host organization. Lisa Williams, founder of placeblogger.com and h2otown, resides in the neighboring community of Watertown and my supervisor just told me to set up a meeting with her. Not to be profane but...WTF!? This entire experience is blowing my mind right now. I&#039;m going to have a blog on CCTV&#039;s website and I&#039;m currently working on a new program (worthy of being crowned by the Knight foundation, I&#039;d say) to place citizen journalists around the city and use all of CCTV&#039;s awesome resources to become the glue that holds these communities together. When the school year begins, I&#039;m also going to be working in a state-of-the-art media studio (which I got to see the other day and it totally blows BU&#039;s facilities out of the water) to create new youth media programs for the educational access channels. I didn&#039;t even know what PEG access &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a month ago...or open-source software, for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the icing on the cake would be that the people here are all really great, and I get to interact with some really diverse members of the community.... and on days like yesterday, I even get to experience surprise visits from Sir Ben Sheldon himself!&lt;/p&gt;
