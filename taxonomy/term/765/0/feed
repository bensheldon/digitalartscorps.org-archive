 <title>How To Pick a Good Candidate for your CTC VISTA Position</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1499</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s true.&amp;nbsp; Most of the CTC VISTAs who apply for projects are fresh college grads.&amp;nbsp; While there are some folks (Boomers, even some Gen X&#039;ers) who apply, the majority of us are fresh outta college and eager to jump in to our first &#039;real world&#039; jobs.&amp;nbsp; But we lack experience.&amp;nbsp; We&#039;re sometimes too idealistic, unpracticed and yes, can need a LOT of support - and not even know how to ask for it.&amp;nbsp; That said, we also have A LOT of skills - particularly around research.&amp;nbsp; We&#039;re smart, Ã¼ber-connected and can learn *very* quickly.&amp;nbsp; We can learn ANYTHING.&amp;nbsp; With this in mind, here&#039;s some tips in selecting an appropriate candidate for your CTC VISTA position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Things To Look For:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Connectedness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Do they have a blog?&amp;nbsp; What about a Facebook Account?&amp;nbsp; Twitter account?&amp;nbsp; Have you Google&#039;d your VISTA candidates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be a no brainer.&amp;nbsp; When you hire your VISTA, you also hire their network.&amp;nbsp; Repeat: &lt;i&gt;when you hire your VISTA, you also hire their network&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; While no VISTA is capable of doing everything alone (nor should you expect them to!), we *are* capable of achieving great things together.&amp;nbsp; We do this by staying connected through various online communication mediums - email, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3A+listserv&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&quot;&gt;listservs&lt;/a&gt;, Google chat, Skype, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook - even people in our &#039;offline&#039; communities.&amp;nbsp; Knowing how to do something is never more than a few keystrokes (or a phone call) away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tip&lt;/i&gt;: we love staying connected to knowledge and resources necessary for our professional development.&amp;nbsp; Use this to your organization&#039;s advantage.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Previous Experience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What were they involved with before?&amp;nbsp; What kinds of experience can *they* bring to your organization? Let &#039;em brag - and then test them on it.&amp;nbsp; Have a conversation about it.&amp;nbsp; Most of our experience may come from staying up late to finish papers or researching new methods, histories or tools of our academic focus.&amp;nbsp; How might these same skills apply to the tasks at hand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tip&lt;/i&gt;: Learn about your VISTA&#039;s previous experience.&amp;nbsp; They can draw from this throughout their year to overcome professional challenges.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Confidence in Learning through Online Social Networks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We may have our email client, chat, Facebook and Twitter accounts open, but it doesn&#039;t mean we aren&#039;t working - we&#039;re learning.&amp;nbsp; We&#039;re fresh out of school and eager to test, experiment and learn more.&amp;nbsp; Within the professional context of &#039;work&#039; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2006/10/the_birth_of_a_.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;informal learning and research&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the name of the game here. Encourage this.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask us to report back what we learn.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We&#039;re sometimes in a constant &#039;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.awag.org/Whats_A_Breakout.htm&quot;&gt;break out session&lt;/a&gt;&#039;. What are we learning?&amp;nbsp; How does what we do online tie back to our offline work at the organization?&amp;nbsp; Through the process of interacting online, we can listen for and test new ideas, succeed (or fail) and integrate what we learn into our daily workflow.&amp;nbsp; Take advantage of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tip&lt;/i&gt;: Social networks are the new internet (or university).&amp;nbsp; For an *optimum* CTC VISTA experience, ask your VISTA &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; they&#039;re socializing/experimenting - and to be honest - &lt;i&gt;playing&lt;/i&gt; with the plethora of internet tools out there.&amp;nbsp; What can they scour from the big &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.savetheinternet.com/=faq#what&quot;&gt;semi-open&lt;/a&gt; Internet to benefit &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; organization?&amp;nbsp; What should they &lt;a href=&quot;http://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2009/01/roi-nonprofit-examples-of-how-listening-returns-value.html&quot;&gt;listen&lt;/a&gt; for?&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;What things are happening online related to your organization&#039;s mission&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Cheap Glasses</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/947</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of you who wear glasses: this spring I got two pairs of prescription eyeglasses (including the lenses) for $8 and $12 from &lt;a href=&quot;http://zennioptical.com/cart/home.php&quot;&gt;zennioptical.com&lt;/a&gt;. My old glasses have broken several times and while I&#039;ve been able to repair them with superglue so far, I know they won&#039;t last forever. The glasses from Zenni Optical aren&#039;t the nicest glasses you&#039;ll ever buy, but they&#039;re great as backup glasses, prescription sunglasses (+$4.95 for the tint), or &quot;my bank account has $50&quot; glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To buy prescription glasses online, you need to have your prescription (duh) including your &quot;pupillary distance.&quot; You can get your prescription from your eye doctor who you got your last pair of glasses from, but you&#039;ll probably have to specifically ask for them to include the pupillary distance; as far as I know they avoid giving it out because it allows you to go elsewhere for prescriptions (but it&#039;s part of your prescription, and yours to know). At Zenni Optical, they don&#039;t require a copy of the prescription, you just enter it in yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few pictures of my new glasses &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/becw/tags/glasses/&quot;&gt;tagged &quot;glasses&quot; in my flickr account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
