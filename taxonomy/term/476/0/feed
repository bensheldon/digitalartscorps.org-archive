 <title>From LA&gt; Boston</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/406</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I arrived in Boston for the first time in life last night to a scary 15 degree climate. Cold to many, but from someone raised in LA an experienced 80 degrees on Christmas, this was just flippin ridiculous.-lol You know how your foot tingles when it falls asleep, yeah that&amp;#39;s how my whole face felt. I missed my first plane @ 620am from LAX to Salt Lake city but was on my on the 8ish am flight with a lay-over in ATL. Goodness gracious why couldn&amp;#39;t I have gone to the pso in Atlanta, would&amp;#39;ve cut the flight in half. Anywho, I&amp;#39;m havin a ball out here in Boston where the accent is apparent. So many green trees and fresh water is foreign to me. It&amp;#39;s like a new concept when you&amp;#39;re accustomed to a smog filled road-raged infested city. I have like 1 of the coolest supervisors ever (Martin Cheesebouroh) of The Media Aid Center. Basically we give inner-city High School kids the opportunity to learn and get inolved with the film and media industry. We teach various software &amp;amp; build sound stages &amp;amp; TV studios in schools. In 07 I&amp;#39;m plotting world domination! I&amp;#39;m still at the pso so I&amp;#39;ve gotta be brief. Who&amp;#39;ve thought I be so darn chatty with my very first Blog entry ever?? Not Mike, no sir. Gotta run. Ya&amp;#39;ll stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Big MikeÂ &lt;/p&gt;
