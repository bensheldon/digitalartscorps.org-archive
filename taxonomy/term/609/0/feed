 <title>What&#039;s Going On.</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/679</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everybody!  Long time, no blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things have been crazy around here as of late, but now that it is spring break, I have one week without OLLIE gigs to catch up on everything that I have been neglecting.  That means four short movies to edit, some DVDs to create, and a website to build.  We&amp;#39;ll see how much I actually get done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In other news, I managed to put together another Kirsten Academy class (after nearly 3 months without one).  The topic this time was stop-motion animation!  Check out the movies we made &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kirstenacademy.blogspot.com&quot; title=&quot;Kirsten Academy&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  We used a program called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.istopmotion.com/&quot; title=&quot;iStopMotion&quot;&gt;iStopMotion&lt;/a&gt;, which can be purchased online for about $40.  Recently, however, I was talking with Andrew of YVXN/NYMAP fame, and he recommended a program called &lt;a href=&quot;http://framethief.com/&quot; title=&quot;FrameThief&quot;&gt;FrameThief&lt;/a&gt;, which is actually free!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if any of you want to make some stop-motion movies as well, download FrameThief, find yourself a digital camcorder and a firewire cable, and get to it.  It&amp;#39;s as easy as that.   If you watch all 5 of our movies (which are all very short), you can see that we used a variety of materials; construction paper, magazines, clay, coloring books, buttons, etc.  It was really easy and lots of fun.  In fact, there have been requests for an encore lesson.  If I ever get around to teaching a second class, I&amp;#39;ll try to put together a tutorial video as well, so that all of you can see how easy it is to make your own animation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After which, I might declare a cross-country CTC VISTA supershort animation contest!  Anybody interested? &lt;/p&gt;
