 <title>Getting settled in</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/988</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So after the flight home to Florida from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.com/dejitarob/AmeriCorpsCTCVISTAOrientation&quot;&gt;PSO&lt;/a&gt;, I made it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.com/dejitarob/GainesvilleToPortland&quot;&gt;Portland in 4 days&lt;/a&gt;. We found a house on the outskirts of the city and were able to get our place furnished all with free stuff from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.craigslist.com/&quot;&gt;craigslist &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;http://freecycle.org/&quot;&gt;freecycle &lt;/a&gt;:D (still looking for a table though). We even found some free tomato plants and some other pre-started veggies for 50 cents each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portland seems pretty cool; I think it&#039;s different than Florida yet similar at the same time. I like the fact that there are a ton of parks, local business, co-ops, collectives, biking and gardening stuff. The city itself is comprised of distinct yet compacted and connected neighborhoods so suburban sprawl has been kept to a minimal level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was expecting there to be more trees in the city (there are zero downtown and not much old growth in the residential areas) and really surprised to find out that there is a lot of heavily polluting industry here. The port is actually a Superfund site, meaning the government is funding the cleanup of toxic waste since the original responsible corporations are no longer around (the actual people might still be, but ridiculously, corporations are defined like people under US law so they usually get off scot free when the business goes under or is sold, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the &lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.com/dejitarob/Portland&quot;&gt;view&lt;/a&gt; from NTEN&#039;s office (as long as you don&#039;t look at the port), I like the fact that my supervisor is really nice and seems to be way more open and respectful than other supervisor&#039;s I have had (especially in grad school). However, I have been doing nothing but data-entry and administrative stuff since I arrived. Although I certainly don&#039;t mind some if it helps others, my wrist was sore from all the repetition. It helped a little bit when I located a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.autohotkey.com&quot;&gt;decent macro application&lt;/a&gt; to slightly automate the transfer of thousands of member entries between two different databases we are using for &quot;constituency relationship management&quot; (CRM). Yes, this is only one of the many buzzwords I have learned over the past few weeks. Personally, I am not a big fan of wannabe catchy pop phrases. But I&#039;ll have to save that for another post :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it looks like I will be moving on to doing less data-entry. I will be posting weekly round ups of interesting discussion on NTEN&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.nten.org/&quot;&gt;Affinity Groups&lt;/a&gt; (fancy mailing lists that are user-driven, i.e. anyone can create one). I also will be developing materials for assisting moderators of the groups. To get practical experience, I created my own group about &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.nten.org/group.htm?mode=home&amp;amp;message=group_privacy_settings_saved&amp;amp;igid=58253&quot;&gt;free/open-source software and Linux&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully, the trend of less data-entry will continue as I become more familiar with the organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Btw, I highly recommend you check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://nten.org&quot;&gt;NTEN&#039;s website&lt;/a&gt; if you have not already. There is a ton of information and lots of &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.nten.org/grouplist.htm&quot;&gt;different groups&lt;/a&gt; in the Affinity Groups platform that might be a good resource for a wide range of things.&lt;/p&gt;
