 <title>Long time, no blog</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/511</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been reluctant to blog not only because it is a bit foreign to me and I don&amp;#39;t know what other people want to hear about me, or if they even care, but mostly because it is available to the public. I would like to share many of my experiences with my fellow VISTAs; however, I am uncomfortable sharing my life and experiences with everyone on the Internet. I also feel like I am restricted to blogging about only the positive things that occur at my organization, what about the not-so-positive ones, the things that aren&amp;#39;t going quite so perfectly? Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I love my org, and know far too well that everything does not always go as planned, and the wonderful experiences I have had thus far completely outweight the less-wonderful ones, but I would like to share those too, and more importantly the lessons that I have learned from them in hopes that another VISTA may benefit. Imagine though, if someone from my organization were to read that blog, I fear that that could create some uncomforatble situations for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure that other VISTAs are experiencing similiar situations, or at least ones you feel you can&amp;#39;t blog about. I think that we could benefit from having an outlet to vent our frustrations, and share creative ideas and solutions. This forum would greatly benefit by having the option of a private blog section for VISTAs only.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if I am alone in this and would appreciate your feedback or support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
