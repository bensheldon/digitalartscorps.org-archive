 <title>I love books.</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1213</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This isn&#039;t really VISTA related, but I just wanted to give a shout-out to the Portland Public Library system, which is super-great.  Due to lack of funds, VISTA&#039;s often have to find free entertainment, and for me, that means the library.  The Portland library system allows me to check out 150 items at once.  They also let me place holds online, and then they ship my books (or DVDs or CDs or whatever else) to the library location of my choice (for free).   All items that I check out are mine for three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently (at the library), I discovered a book series called The Story of Science, by Joy Hakim.  Although it seems to be written for 5th graders, I found all three books to be fascinating (especially the second book, &quot;Newton At the Center&quot;, and the second half of the third book, &quot;Einstein Adds a New Dimension&quot;).  In fact, I am now considering going back to school after my VISTA term is up, and becoming a scientist.  Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
