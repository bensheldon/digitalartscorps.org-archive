 <title>The DASCorps Survival Guide: Grant Writing</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1797</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Finding, writing, submitting, and winning a grant is not an easy task. It is time consuming, technical (not in the fun DASCorps sense), and complex. This section will try to break down some basics so you’ll know where to start and then go through the general steps towards receiving a grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your workplan is or becomes heavily geared towards writing grant proposals, we strongly suggest that you ask your host organization to pay for you to take a grant writing course (usually offered online or at local colleges). You may even be able to get this paid for by Americorps using your IST funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not all grants are created equal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are many different kinds of grant opportunities out there from a variety of sources. These typically breakdown into government (federal, state, local) or foundation grant funding. Federal grants are much more time consuming and process driven than typical foundation grants, however they usually offer much larger funding and can fund an organization for several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an RFP?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
RFP stands for Request For Proposals and generally means that a foundation is currently accepting grant applications for specific types of programs or organizations. Foundations also use RFP’s as a way to publicize new initiatives or programs sponsored or endorsed by the foundation. So do your homework to find out more on a foundation’s motives and new initiatives when they put out an RFP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Before diving headfirst into a grant application, make sure you have these basic components already planned and organized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to explain the need for your project or program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define your outcomes and how they will be measured (metrics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will you achieve these outcomes (methods)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate why your organization is the one to undertake this project or program (credibility)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will you know when you’ve succeeded?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate a program or project budget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will the program or project live on after the grant?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimally you will be matching a program that’s already been planned for to a grant opportunity. Unfortunately, sometimes organizations may look for a grant and then develop a program to fulfill that grant. Be careful as too often this leads to programs and projects that may be outside your organization’s mission and scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding Funders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thankfully, researching funders and grant opportunities has been greatly simplified by many free online databases. Here a few of the best sites (see “Further Resources” at the end of this section for more grant databases):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community Foundation Locator (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cof/locator.org&quot;&gt;www.cof/locator.org&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Foundation Center (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fdcenter.org&quot;&gt;www.fdcenter.org&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FirstGov (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firstgov.gov/Business/Nonprofit.shtml#fundraising&quot;&gt;www.firstgov.gov/Business/Nonprofit.shtml#fundraising&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guidestar (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guidestar.org&quot;&gt;www.guidestar.org&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Grantsmanship Center (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tgci.com&quot;&gt;www.tgci.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Philanthropy Journal (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.philanthropyjournal.org&quot;&gt;www.philanthropyjournal.org&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make life easier on yourself and the people you have to communicate to about your grant writing undertaking, create a thorough spreadsheet that will detail all your potential funders, grant due dates, contacts, type of grant, etc…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Found The Grant! Now What?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As tempting as it is to jump in and start writing the grant, pause for a minute and give the funder a call. There may be a contact person or phone number listed for posted grants. Personal contact is a great jumping off point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get someone on the phone, give a concise “elevator pitch” saying “Hi my name is  ____ and I’m an Americorps*VISTA with insert organization name and I’d like to talk to you about insert program name and purpose.” If nothing else you won’t get an outright ‘no’ from someone (since it will probably be lower level staff), and it will help get your foot in the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Query Letter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The first formal part of a grant application is the Query Letter, which grant founders will use to invite you to submit the full grant proposal. The query letter runs approximately 2-3 pages and typically includes the following (which should already be documented in your pre-planning):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organization’s name, what you are seeking funds for, and how much &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your organization’s mission, history, and current programs &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definition of the community need (who, what, and where)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How you’re going to address the need and measure its success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any other supporters you have or will approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrap-up, restate goals, and thank the funder &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing the Full Proposal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So the funder has invited your full proposal after the query letter or you’ve been lucky enough to find a grant that does not require one. Now it’s time to write the full proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is monumentally important before you even put your organization down in the name box to take a good deal of time and THOROUGHLY go over the grant’s guidelines and requirements. Many VISTAs have been torpedoed by the tiniest oversights on a proposal that would have otherwise secured a grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you know the guidelines inside and out, it is finally time to start the full grant proposal. Below is a general list of all the pieces needed for a full grant application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Title page and Table of contents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Executive summary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background statement/Organizational qualifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statement of community need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project’s large-scale goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project’s immediate objectives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Action plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanation of how you evaluate project’s success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statement of how the project will be funded and sustainable into the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any and all relevant attachments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some general tips when writing the full grant proposal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write with some passion and conviction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate that your organization is the best one for the job (demonstrate that your organization IS an authority on what you are pursuing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be honest and realistic in what you plan to do with funds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Echo the funder’s key words and phrases in your application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not spend a lot of time on the introduction, as funders look more to solid program plans, evaluation methods, and budgets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 <title>Month Ten: Digital Divide / Budget Gap</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1680</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of these past few weeks have been about grant writing and grant research.  The hope is that we can get enough grant money to sustain our community technology program through this year and then develop more sustainable programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next month, I hope to focus more on putting together a business plan for more sustainable income.  I also hope to work more on fundraisers.  I&#039;m not sure that holding huge fundraisers is the only option; I know we are way way way in the hole, but I think small fundraisers might be more realistic and would go toward building awareness of our tech/media programs as well.  What are the &quot;best&quot; ways to fundraise?  Is it more practical to do a bunch of small things or invest a lot in something &quot;big?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other things... I&#039;ve put some work into the community council website.  It&#039;s not the visual overhaul I&#039;ve been hoping for (maybe that&#039;ll happen later) but it does have a calendar and will now have a spot for press releases.  This is important because the Little Tokyo Community Council has previously been unable to put forth &quot;opinions&quot; and viewpoints on key issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to working on something besides grants.  With our Digital Literacy teacher leaving, I might be working on more curriculum development and teaching digital media to seniors (yay!).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Writing a Federal Grant: What to Expect</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1085</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;WARNING! Federal grant applications are, by far, the most difficult and the most competitive type of proposal to write, even for veteran grant writers. They require more than 100 hours of work reading/understanding application requirements, researching and writing. On the other hand, if awarded, they are extremely beneficial to your organization, offering substantial, multi-year funding and credibility in future fund-seeking endeavors. The following is my advice after completing my first federal grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Carefully read the announcements and rules in the Federal Register and application guidelines.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reviewing the RFP, make sure that your organization&#039;s purpose, priorities and geographic region are compatible with the gov&#039;ts announcement. Also, make sure you and your staff will have enough time to meet the deadline. Usually, the funder won&#039;t allow much time to complete these &quot;bears&quot; or &quot;whales&quot; or whatever gigantic and unforgiving animal you&#039;d like to compare these grants to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as completing the actual application, the guidelines are extremely specific and the reviewers will first examine your ability to comply with their technical requirements. Trust me, they will really make you jump through hoops. If you fail here...your application will not progress to the next level of review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Outline the process / time line you intend to follow for the project and share it with staff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, make a checklist with everything that needs to be done and which staff member is responsible for accomplishing it. This will give you a good idea of who you will be working closely with, and how much work you&#039;re personally responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, make a calendar for just the time you have until the deadline. It&#039;s also good to share this with staff. Pad your personal deadline to account for your reliance on &quot;briskness&quot; of your coworkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, plan to finish several work days before the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Begin the information gathering process. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be expected to gather much of the same kinds of information for this grant, just like any other (organization history, mission, staff, accomplishments, goals of your project, etc). On the contrary, you will be asked to provide &quot;documentation&quot; for most of the arguments you make in your narrative. For instance, you may be asked to document the project&#039;s planning/development, or perhaps show evidence of the support of local residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showing documentation and attempting to quantify benefits of the project/number of people affected by project is time consuming. I accomplished this task by sending out a survey to people in the community that would benefit from this grant. Once participants completed the survey and clicked &quot;submit,&quot; the information was sent to my email box. I entered the data into a spreadsheet, and drew statistical information to support my project from it. I suggest this as a simple/quick solution. Below is a link to the survey I used, although I don&#039;t know how long my organization will keep it posted. Other ways to accomplishing this request include community meeting minutes and public forums.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://main.nc.us/bbsurvey/&quot;&gt;http://main.nc.us/bbsurvey/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the information gathering process should be spent digging up buried information that you know you&#039;ll need. It involves contacting various departments within your org (finance, admin, etc) and stockpiling information you&#039;ll need for reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Letters of support take a long time to coordinate and receive. They are necessary when applying for a federal grant. It is beneficial to solicit a letter of support from a state representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Seek a peer reviewer and don&#039;t be afraid to contact the Program Officer with your questions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peer review is an excellent opportunity to check over your work. If you know a fundraising professional who has written a grant before, make a copy of the application guidelines and your application. Give them a day or two to make some recommendations. I guarantee you&#039;ll sleep better after the grant is submitted if haven&#039;t relied solely on your own faculties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some links:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cfda.gov&quot;&gt;Catalog of Federal and Domestic Assistance&lt;/a&gt; - this site lists the federal gov&#039;ts standard proposal review criteria. Click on &quot;winning grant proposals&quot; on the left side of the homepage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grants.gov&quot;&gt;E-Grants&lt;/a&gt; - the master directory for Federal grant information.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firstgov.gov/Government/State_Local.shtml&quot;&gt;FirstGov&lt;/a&gt; - a federal site that is the gateway for all federal and state agencies that make grant awards.&lt;/p&gt;
