 <title>Month Eight: The BTOP Shuffle</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1665</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;March was crazy.  LTSC had applied as a partner with a bunch of other California organizations for funding on the first round of BTOP, a federal grant for developing broadband access.  First, we found out that we didn&#039;t get the first round grant; then, we learned we were being dropped from the partnership.  So, we decided to apply on our own for the next round, which meant the beginning of March was pretty much non-stop grant writing and cranking out a 50-page application in about a week and a half.  We probably won&#039;t get this second round, but it was worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the application has been submitted, I&#039;ve gone back to the networking and training of residents.  I&#039;ve recruited a few residents to become &quot;Network Representatives.&quot;  Starting next week, they&#039;ll be learning about the free internet at their building, how to fix it, etc.  They&#039;ll also be learning how to teach their fellow residents how to log on, how to troubleshoot, etc.  Hoping to recruit more volunteers so every building has two representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have also been trying to stabilize the free wifi at this building.  So far, it has involved frankensteining some equipment, some soldering, and a lot of dragging ethernet cable through bird shit.  :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope everyone is doing well as we approach the final few months...&lt;/p&gt;
