 <description>&lt;p&gt;Whoops, it&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve done one of these things. So my car was unable to pass smog and I&#039;m currently trying to get the guy who sold it to me to give me my money back and he&#039;s dodging my calls. Thankfully my boss knows someone in Marin (where I got it) who used to do lemon law stuff and now does legal aid, so hopefully she can put the fear of God in him. But now I have a moped, which is exciting and insurance is only $9 a month, so you can&#039;t beat that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project-wise things are still in early stages yet. I&#039;m looking at applications to hire a programmer for one of our sites (californiavoices.org if you know anyone who&#039;s good at Ruby on Rails and wants a low paying job you can send them my way). And moving the rest of them around so that they all are on joomla instead of a mix of random CMSes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like up until this point there hasn&#039;t been much standardization in the way they do web things. Everything is in different languages, hosted by different people in different places. So it&#039;s a little crazy making, but I&#039;m slowly trying to pull everything together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I haven&#039;t had the food stamps issues a lot of people seem to be. Other than my mail seems to be super super slow so I got a letter the other day saying that because I hadn&#039;t turned something in they were going to cut me off, but when I called they said they&#039;d gotten the paper work.&lt;/p&gt;
