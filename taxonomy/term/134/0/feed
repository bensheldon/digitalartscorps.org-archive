 <description>&lt;p&gt;It is mid-October and we are still hoping to shoot more video training sessions in the field before winter.  Currently we have two of them shot.  The goal is for three.  We have also talked about shooting a total of four, possibly doing one in the spring.  These instructional videos will be about 20-30 minutes in length.  The first one is on Equipment training (mainly how to run a small farm walk-behind tractor), the second is Irrigation of crops.  I&#039;m learning lots about small farming!  More about the economics of this type of business..the things that people should learn before venturing into their own business.  The third field training that we hope to shoot is on Pest control or weed management.  We have also been shooting &#039;farmer to farmer&#039; interview moments that will be used in the on-line distance learning modules.  We have captured one of these already, interviewing a recent graduate who is now successfully farming in N. Reading.  Lydia, the recent grad, runs her own CSA (Community supported Ag.) with members.  She distributes to her shareholders in Somerville MA and also in N. Reading.  We hope to shoot one more &#039;farmer to farmer&#039; moment this month.  Also, the promo slideshow is done and now posted on youtube.com/NESFP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My agency has old VHS training videos from various farm organizations.  I am in the process of transferring these to DVD.  These films and videos are part of their existing lending library.  Converting to DVD will squeeze more life out of the tapes, and make it possible for more people to use at home.  This will be an on-going project throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up in the winter months, I&#039;ll mainly be editing the training videos.  There is also a plan to help some undergrad students with their senior project film, by contributing existing video footage and access to our farm sites.  It is going to be about sustainable agriculture in MA.  This will give NESFP more visibility with a short documentary film release next spring.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Reviewed the current equipment at NESFP, and created a wishlist of new equipment that I feel would benefit the organization in their media expansion.  New Equipment: digital HD camcorder (Canon VIXIA HF S10), one External Hard Drive (G-Technology 1TB G-Raid3), an external Disk Burner (LaCie d2 Blu-ray Drive), blank disks and a spare battery for the camera.  The Blu-Ray burner is for archiving raw and edited video for their long-term storage.  The new camera and accessories have arrived!  I am getting familiar with our new toys.  The Canon camcorder is great. We had our annual open house farm tour this month.  Our first shoot was successful. I worked on creating a database of footage from Final Cut.  This is a pretty straight forward process.  In Final Cut Pro, you can export a batch list of any bin or bins with footage.  This file can then be imported into a spreadsheet.  The idea behind creating this database is to enable a user to search the existing video library for footage and interviews. Hard drive space management might be an issue as we shoot more (ie: running out of room for all footage).  In field with Don and Ben to videotape the assembly of a greenhouse.  Also went to video Swine School in N. Grafton.  This was an all-day event including lecture and demonstration with all things Swine.  Rough cut shot and edited of Equipment training.  Also edited a rough cut of photo promo.  Using Vimeo to host rough cuts, and eventually Youtube for promos.  Shooting schedule is busy through October.  and now..back to you.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Month 11: Final Workshops and Facility Recommendations</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1513</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In May/June, I offered several training workshops, likely the last round of dedicated sessions as my year of VISTA service comes to a close.  The remainder of my year will be devoted to compiling the training materials I&#039;ve written, and writing the manuals I haven&#039;t had time to compose yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the three video production workshops I led, one was an interactive session with students from the READY School in Champaign, IL.  After an initial tour of our facilities and those of Urbana Public Television, the students checked out free camcorders and videotaped a day at their school, with interviews and shots of classrooms, art, bulletin boards, and the building itself.  Our training session covered the fundamentals of cutting, arranging, and editing scenes, using Adobe Premiere Pro.  The students, whose school year is finished, now have two local resources for continued learning where they can finish this and other films if they would like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the training sessions were about A/V data backup, transfer, and duplication, as members of the IMC get ready to work more independently after I have finished my service.  Beyond these and other basic recording and editing tips, two of the audio workshops addressed key issues for citizen journalists - 1) posting to the web and 2) understanding the principles of digital audio and their application.  Finally, I have been working with our community radio station WRFU, to ensure that members are knowledgeable about making PSAs, news stories, and updating their Drupal site.  In the last month, I will compile and share these resources; for now, I have been revising the manuals as I go, and sharing with smaller working groups.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though we often use commercial software like Premiere at the IMC, the only real expenses that any artists or journalists should ever have to face are time and hardware (cameras, mics, computers, a/v equipment, etc.).  I encourage everyone I train to use and tell others about free and open source software (FOSS), and this month I continued my research into these tools.  Specifically, FOSS operating systems can be installed (easily and for free) and used to keep older and slower computers running quickly and efficiently - especially important for organizations with small budgets.  Operating systems I recommend are Ubuntu (which has many variants, including one with media production applications called Ubuntu Studio), Puppy Linux, Dyne:bolic, and Pure:dyne.  There are others, but these systems have familiar desktop and window environments, can be expanded to include office productivity and media software, and some even run off of live CDs, so no installation is necessary.  We received a donated laptop that was quite slow, running Windows 98 - now with the most recent version of Xubuntu, it is much faster and is available for IMC members to use for on-location recording, broadcast, and web publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A critical component of documentation is not just manuals or progress reports, but recommendations.  The final aspect of capacity building requires communicating to your organization what they can do to grow after the absence of VISTA staff.  At the IMC I am in the process of troubleshooting and listing improvements that could be made to the production facilities - via hardware that will need to be purchased, and software that is free.  Luckily for us, we just hired some summer youth employees through the Champaign Consortium, and each individual has his/her own project to use as a learning experience and as a service to the IMC - adding to the continuity and capacity built so far with VISTAs.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Month 9: Curriculum &amp; Program Development</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1496</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Through March-April, a very intense month, I guided several initiatives to create new training programs for youth and adults, to build volunteer activities at the IMC, and to make general improvements to our facilities.  The most involved of these is the Champaign, IL &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dmbgc-cu.org/&quot;&gt;Don Moyers Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club&lt;/a&gt; (DMBGC) Teen Computer Lab project, a partnership between the Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucimc.org/&quot;&gt;Independent Media Center&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://illinois.edu/&quot;&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, and the local, private computer consulting firm &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.supportechcomputers.com/&quot;&gt;SupporTech&lt;/a&gt;.  During the first month of planning, the partnering organizations agreed to a vision and mission for the new computer lab and training program to be offered by the DMBGC, which will be an ongoing program available to youth ages 6-18, throughout the year.  The IMC has led the development of surveys, curriculum, and budget, informing the design and staffing being organized by the other partners.  Our Program Development Intern Jason Keist wrote the surveys to assess the children&#039;s experience and interests, and I have been composing the lab budget and compiling a variety of technology and media tutorials and activities, all of which will also be stored with the IMC as documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with IMC member Danielle Chynoweth, I presented a workshop on producing radio news for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fsrn.org/&quot;&gt;Free Speech Radio News&lt;/a&gt; (FSRN), a grassroots independent half-hour newscast available online and syndicated to over 100 stations worldwide.  Please see the attachment for the training guide I wrote (geared towards Audacity, though any audio editor is appropriate).  Anyone can pitch a story, headline, or feature to FSRN, and once you produce the content, FSRN pays you and includes your piece in one of its daily newscasts.  I strongly recommend that other VISTAs encourage members, customers, and trainers in your organization(s) to learn and participate in FSRN as a resource for citizen journalism, media reform, smearing the digital divide, and earning income for a job well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also participated in a roundtable discussion on social media presented at the University of Illinois by Chicago&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newstips.org/&quot;&gt;Community Media Workshop&lt;/a&gt; (CMW), a group devoted to training news producers and journalists, and strengthening ties between media and populations in Chicago and the midwest.  I recommend CMW as a useful resource to anyone working in these geographic areas.  They inspired me to create a &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/UCIMC&quot;&gt;Twitter account for the IMC&lt;/a&gt; - simple, but necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring was productive in even more ways at the IMC, and I organized three volunteer workdays - one for the Shows/Booking group to troubleshoot, repair, and re-organize the PA, mixer, stage, and cables; one for WRFU 104.5FM to produce new station IDs and clean and paint the studio; and another for just plain spring cleaning of the building.  Along with volunteers in the Librarians and Tech working groups, Nicole and members of the Community Connections group, I setup a staffing desk with a computer workstation, IMC merchandise tables, and staff storage space in the entry to the main space of our building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Production group, I offered three more workshops on video editing, wrote Terms of Use and Borrowing for our production room and public equipment, and upgraded one of our video workstations with funds we raised during the Film Festival.  Finally, following Nicole&#039;s hard work to obtain summer youth (ages 14-24) positions at the IMC through the Champaign Consortium, I defined one of the positions, a WRFU Audio Trainer and Archivist, who will join us soon to produce regular on-air content, update our public affairs automation, train members on live and studio broadcast, and archive our existing audio materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there was all the planning for another major fundraiser, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imcfest.org/&quot;&gt;IMC Fest&lt;/a&gt;... (see next month)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Month 7: Inauguration Video Diary &amp; IMC FILM FEST 2009</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1494</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Jan-Feb began a two month period in which both Nicole and I barely took a day off - no exaggeration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possible exception was a trip that a few of us made to Washington, D.C. for the Presidential Inauguration.  We planned this trip on short notice, to correspond to a community organizing event taking place at the IMC on the night of the inauguration - the idea being that we would film a documentary, or more appropriately a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucimc.org/content/u-c-imc-inauguration-2009-dc-trip-day-3-video-mlk-day-inauguration-day-photos&quot;&gt;video diary&lt;/a&gt; of our experiences, post daily clips to our web site, and then have a Skype video conference with everyone &quot;back home.&quot;  Going with both my VISTA Supervisor and VISTA Leader gave me an excellent opportunity to get to know them better and learn from their areas of expertise.  Many superlatives apply to being in the capitol for that ceremony, mostly having to do with the sheer numbers of people crowding the streets and the willingness of strangers to be interviewed in the cold by other strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as we returned, I went straight back to the planning for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imcfilmfest.org/&quot;&gt;IMC Film Fest&lt;/a&gt;.  There was still much to do, including designing and distributing fliers and posters, doing interviews with local press and arts/events magazines, recording and broadcasting radio advertisements, and working with filmmakers to determine the final schedule.  The Film Fest was a success, comprising three days of independent, and most local/regional films, covering all lengths and genres.  We raised money for the IMC Production group, the group I helped create that maintains the media production facilities and builds a team of trainers who can assist and teach others.  I learned quite a lot about event planning and management; the small group of us that put it all together have a vast train of e-mails and Google docs that we are archiving with the IMC to help others create similar events in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this period involved less training than usual, just a couple of sessions on audio and video recording, and I continued to update and troubleshoot the WRFU radio automation system while helping to facilitate meetings of those interested in learning this &quot;back-stage&quot; aspect of radio production.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Month 5: Independence + Collaboration = Success</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1418</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The past month was probably the most successful for my VISTA project so far.   While this was due in no small part to the groundwork of the previous months, over the course of only the last few weeks I trained (trainers and students), recruited volunteers, made new community contacts, and produced media.  I credit this productivity with a) working independently and b) communicating frequently about my work to others to involve them and get their feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Mid-November started slowly, as I helped the Shows group (books concerts and events for the IMC) assume their own responsibilities, by helping to draft a new contract with the IMC Finance group, updating their Drupal &lt;a href=&quot;http://shows.ucimc.org/&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; and web calendar, and training a volunteer on meeting facilitation, sound, and web/calendar administration.   Having that particular group grow to be more independent and capable frees me from a lot of extra, small tasks, and saves the rest of the IMC time and effort, as well.  With more time to focus on the broader goals of my assignment, I have been gradually giving closer attention to the Production group that I helped start in the summer.  The Production group (site in development) manages the IMC’s media production room, loans equipment to community projects, produces original content, and offers training on multimedia.  Along with Production volunteers, Nicole Pion and I started planning an IMC Film Festival for February 6-8, 2009, which will last three days and showcase a variety of genres, especially work by local/regional filmmakers, and will also include art, music, and food from local sponsoring restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Other accomplishments of the Production group, which now contains a core of six independent journalist/producers, were four new videos (a total of 3.5 hours) that we have shared with Urbana Public Television and which will also be available online at our site and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/UrbanaChampaignIMC&quot;&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;.  Coverage ranged from stories about a local activist, IMC concert footage, People’s Potluck Thanksgiving, and a Proposition 8 protest.  A group of 3 volunteers filmed performances and interviews at a benefit concert for our radio station.  I have also started helping the IMC’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.books2prisoners.org/&quot;&gt;Books to Prisoners&lt;/a&gt; program with a video project that they will begin shooting and editing in the New Year to highlight their presence in town, their training, and the prison libraries that they staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	In the course of recruiting volunteers to produce new media, I did quite a bit of editing myself, especially audio, and it turns out that this is a modest source of extra income for the host organization, which makes it worthwhile.  More valuable, however, is the opportunity to instruct others on how to edit.  Between Shows, Production, and Books to Prisoners members, I trained three individuals who will now be ready to train others on the basics of production and got them to think about how they can utilize media technology to further their groups’ goals.  Over the next few months, I will be compiling my tutorials (and other online sources) for a wiki that our VISTA supervisor Josh King is developing for the IMC (Josh has chosen &lt;a href=&quot;http://twiki.org/&quot;&gt;Twiki&lt;/a&gt;, as it has revision control and is used by the global &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indymedia.org/en/index.shtml&quot;&gt;Indymedia&lt;/a&gt; network).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	There was quite a bit of interest in learning audio recording and editing this past month, with IMC members attending a variety of public lectures, discussions, or wanting to produce their own interviews or radio commentaries.  I offered a series of three one-on-one tutorials on recording field audio (using a Zoom H2); compiling a musical set list (ala the quickly arcane term, “mix tape”) for radio; and recording and editing speech for use on radio or film.  I chose the free and easy &lt;a href=&quot;http://audacity.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt; for the training, and even though I know a lot of people are familiar with how to use it, I’ll attach my quick guide here just in case anyone is interested.   There are many more tips and tutorials &lt;a href=&quot;http://audacityteam.org/wiki/index.php?title=Tutorials&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	The final area in which I feel I made great progress was at the IMC’s community radio station, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wrfu.net/&quot;&gt;WRFU&lt;/a&gt;.  First, I revived the station’s Tech group, which had been inactive since before I started as a VISTA.  The Tech group maintains studio equipment, updates and repairs software and Internet connectivity, and offers technical guidance for membership training.   After a few e-mails about the lack of tech support, a core group of 4-6 of us decided to set up a new computer at the DJ desk, fix and label cables and mixer inputs, and begin a construction plan for more shelves, storage, and a patchbay.  In September I had been responsible for training dozens of airshifters, but in the process of bringing back the Tech group, we realized that we were training more trainers (and training ourselves to be better experts and instructors at the station).  Two University of Illinois graduate students in the Library Sciences department finished their radio automation and music library training manual, which I had been supervising since the fall.  This manual, now available in our office next to the studio, gives DJs and tech support step-by-step instructions on how to add local music, PSAs, and other pre-produced shows to our non-live rotation, how to classify content as clean, and how to edit it if it is not clean.  The system is based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zarastudio.es/index.php?section=main&amp;amp;lang=en&quot;&gt;ZaraRadio&lt;/a&gt;, iTunes, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Juice&lt;/a&gt; podcast player, and the volunteers used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.karenware.com/&quot;&gt;Karen’s Directory Printer&lt;/a&gt; to generate a station inventory.  Nicole and I visited the Library Science department for presentations on their projects and to represent the IMC, and while there we learned about other great community engagement/technology instruction programs that are going on in our town.  Earlier this week the librarians even thanked me by having me on their final show of the semester for an interview about my role as a CTC VISTA.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A Swing State Update</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1397</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This story takes place in Ohio. I know some of you coastal VISTAs are longing for more Ohio news and charming Midwestern commentary, like you were getting before the election. Perfect timing for me to wake from my procrastination hibernation and write my very first field report! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am serving as Youth Channel Facilitator at Media Bridges &lt;a&gt;www.mediabridges.org&lt;/a&gt;, a community media center that operates Cincinnati’s four public access television stations. My job is to develop a youth media program that will allow Cincinnati youth (ages 12-25) to run Media Bridges’ youth channel. The youth channel, called the Youth Block, airs youth-created programming on Media Bridges’ education channel. Part of my job is to acquire 10 hours each week of programming to be played on our Youth Block (currently we have about four hours), and to develop a plan for volunteer youth to run the Youth Block. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is that youth who participate in the program will learn the tools to understand how media represents youth and constructs messages which affect them. We hope that students will gain the confidence and ability to use video and radio production skills to represent themselves and get their voices out to the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first month here I worked with the kids in our summer video and radio camp. Each class finishes with the production of a video or radio show by the kids. Right now, the summer media camp is the only established youth program at Media Bridges, and a primary source of our Youth Block programming, so I am hoping to expand on that. I’ve also been taking crash courses in all the cool technology toys we have here: I’ve learned to use a video camera, operate studio cameras, lighting and sound equipment, run a live studio show, and edit digital video. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past few months have been spent researching existing youth media programs in other cities and meeting with local organizations that work with youth in order to build partnerships and get the word out about the Youth Block. In September I organized an event for One Web Day at Media Bridges (&lt;a&gt;http://mediabridges.org/onewebday/&lt;/a&gt;). In October, I attended the Alliance for Community Media Central States Region conference and I also supervised a high school student who interned with me for a week as part of a senior project. In November I have been helping to revamp Media Bridges’ volunteer program to help recruit younger volunteers, and I am taking a proposal writing course online and working on writing grant proposals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s just the basics, but stay tuned for more lively and detailed reports from the heartland as I get caught up on my field report quota. Hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Month 2: Out in the community already (“Hi public, we’re the media… but you can trust us.”)</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1372</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I am submitting two reports at once this time.  The past two months were so busy that there was little time to reflect or to write about what was going on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the second month at my organization, I delved further into media training and started an active video news project with some volunteers.    Most of my work this month was interactive and in the community, so in contrast to my plans, I did not have much time to write training manuals.  A notable exception was authoring a revised Airshifter Handbook for WRFU 104.5-LP, our community radio station, with an extra manual on remote/live broadcast and streaming radio.  The last version of the handbook had been written two or three years ago, and lacked a discussion of the goals of the organization or a studio checklist for DJs new to the radio.  After talking with the Station Manager, we realized that a new handbook alone would not have much effect unless we also scheduled small group training sessions so we could discuss the social, legal, and technical aspects of running a community radio show.  Our efforts were successful and now WRFU has an established program for orienting new DJs and getting new shows on the air, while respecting the needs and goals of the IMC as a whole, which includes other groups beyond the radio station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those other groups is IMC Production, a volunteer group that I helped create in order to carry on and combine the legacies of the separate Video and Radio News groups that ceased to exist around two years ago.   Simply put, all the IMC groups make sure that some different aspect of independent media is alive, productive, and engaged with the local population.  Production is here to create audio-visual content for the community and for other groups, and to provide the facilities and personnel to make this possible.  While our work to improve the studio is slow, in only my second month as a VISTA, we were able to initiate IMC Video News.  IMC Video News actively searches for local or regional stories that are not being covered by other stations, goes out on-site to interview and shoot, and then edits and produces short-length film for distribution online and on Urbana Public Television.  Even though others in the IMC look to us for technical multimedia advice, we spend far more time interacting with the public than sitting in front of computer screens editing.  This has turned out to be very beneficial for our organization’s outreach and public relations, because we are listening to – and publishing – voices that others are ignoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, we produced segments on a Greenpeace Solar-Powered Concert (where I ran the mixer, too – next to a solar panel the size of a roof) and the closing of Illinois State Parks.  We also assisted with an Iraq Veterans Against the War forum on post-traumatic stress disorder (for UPTV) and re-published the local Books to Prisoners’ Our Volunteer Experience film online.  A sample of our work to date can be accessed on our new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/UrbanaChampaignIMC&quot;&gt;UC-IMC YouTube Channel&lt;/a&gt;.  To get this project going, we have been using Adobe Premiere, but we will be expanding to incorporate more open-source software for editing.  Two open-source/freeware video utilities that have been crucial to my work here have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://handbrake.fr&quot; /&gt;Handbrake&lt;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/mp4cam2avi&quot; /&gt;MP4CAM2AVI&lt;/a&gt;.  Of course, &lt;a href=&quot;http://audacity.sourceforge.net&quot; /&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt; is a robust, simple, and reliable solution for audio editing that I would recommend to anyone and which most people seem to know, anyway.  Though not technically free (you can use it for free with no features suspended or get a license for $50), I recommend Windows’ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reaper.fm&quot; /&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; for multi-track audio editing and sequencing because it is easy, allows for flexible routing, comes with high-quality processing built-in, and accepts most free or commercial VST and DirectX plugins.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t end there, though.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sunlightfoundation.com&quot; /&gt;Sunlight Foundation&lt;/a&gt; webinar that I scheduled between members of WRFU, Production, and Public i (the IMC’s independent newspaper) was a small event, but so useful that I am posting the links here for CTC VISTAs to view.  Bill Allison guided us through an overwhelming tour of websites that allow any citizen with Internet access to closely investigate the finances, bills, and records of members in the United States Congress, as well as information on lobbyists, federal contracts, and elections.  Obviously, these types of topics and data are of great interest to journalist and media organizations like mine in the IndyMedia network, but this set of links provides another set of tools that all community organizers can use to bridge the digital divide and help the groups they are working with attain greater access to knowledge and the political process in their states and in the nation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Congresspedia&quot;&gt;Congresspedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencongress.org&quot; /&gt;OpenCongress.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.govtrack.us&quot; /&gt;GovTrack.us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.senate.gov&quot; /&gt;Senate.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fec.gov&quot; /&gt;Federal Election Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://sunlightmediaservices.com&quot; /&gt;Sunlight Media Services&lt;/a&gt; - This deserves a special note for technology users/junkies: widgets with updated political and congressional data that you can embed in a web site or blog.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politicker.com&quot; /&gt;Politicker.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensecrets.org&quot; /&gt;OpenSecrets.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune535.sunlightprojects.org&quot; /&gt;Fortune535&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fedspending.org&quot; /&gt;FedSpending.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taxpayer.net&quot; /&gt;TaxPayer.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, when even progressive mainstream media does not address all the questions your community may be asking:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.democracynow.org&quot; /&gt;DemocracyNow.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pacifica.org&quot; /&gt;Pacifica.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	I hope some of you find these links useful in your own VISTA work.  Between radio, video, and live events, I trained around 30 individuals in the second month and identified many new resources that have helped me and others.  Meanwhile, I got inundated with direct service… but I’ll save that story for the month 3 report.&lt;/p&gt;

It&#039;s a documentary of the GET: Girls Empowering Together project. Working with 15 students from central high school, the young women were taught leadership skills and worked with community mentors this school year. Program was a partnership between Aquinas College, the GRCMC and GRPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah worked with these young women to produce, shoot and edit this documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
