 <title>Good morning CTC VISTA Project</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Good Morning, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the sun is rising here in Michigan on chilly Friday. My computer is now by the window, so I can look out on the sky, the trees, the road, and the apartment complex office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Jeanne, my supervisor, said, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s the last good day for a bike ride.&amp;quot; She was probably right. It was unusually nice yesterday and it&amp;#39;s supposed to get colder starting today. But you never know. There could always be a 60 degree day in December. This is Michigan, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work has been keeping me pretty busy, the last couple weeks. MoLLIE was out at a school nearly every day for two weeks. Now we&amp;#39;re settling back into a lighter schedule. And I really want to focus on developing an audio class. We don&amp;#39;t have surveys in yet telling us that that is specifically what the community wants, but I&amp;#39;m starting to think I should just proceed as if we have.  Not having the survey&amp;#39;s is just a way of procrastinating on doing something that I&amp;#39;ve never done, and thus is scary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;m going to go over my syllabi (syllabuses?) from my audio production class at Grand Valley and think about what would work for a beginning and advanced class. Seems like a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In life news; I got a car. I&amp;#39;ve been without a car since July. And it really is no good in Grand Rapids. The public transit has improved over the years, but it&amp;#39;s still not great for much besides going to and from work, and even then only if you are on a bus route (which fortunately I was). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a car means I can go out some nights. Especially nights when there are open mics for me to go and play my guitar and sing some songs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My roommate and I are finally having a &amp;quot;house&amp;quot;-warming party. Which also doubles as a post Halloween, post-election celebration. And it&amp;#39;s seems to have a six degrees of seperation aspect as well. If any VISTA&amp;#39;s are in GR on Saturday, let me know, I&amp;#39;ll give you directions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#39;m probably already going a bit long for a blog. So I think I&amp;#39;ll say adu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich &lt;/p&gt;
