 <title>Hard work and fresh faces</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;After lackluster performances in July and August, the back-to-school rush has given WildTech new life--and a new volunteer with it.  Jesse Crowther, an Americorps recruit from the area, has been instrumental in this sudden resurgence.  He came to us through the Washington Service Corps with  high expectations  and an insatiable curiosity.  Since his entry earlier this month, the gears of a sophisticated machine are slowly falling into place.  Mr. Crowther has exhibited phenomenal organizational ability as well as unmatched capacity to adapt to  whatever challenges are thrown his way.  Case in point: Our main work area was absolutely unusable before he arrived; and we were not exactly a model for speed and efficiency.  Mr. Crowther saw this and took steps to fix it, installing a priority board and creating a workable system for maintaining the tools we use.  The long-overdue cleanup, combined  with some well-timed elbow grease, has netted WildTech two large sales totaling over $5000--and the final numbers are still unconfirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also opened a new satellite lab in Bellevue, enabling us to reach those who lie deep below the polished surface of Seattle&#039;s Eastside.  Mr. Crowther&#039;s assistance plays big here as well.  According to his own testimony, he has drawn many young teenagers into computer repair, their eyes ablaze with wonder as he guides them around the inside of a machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet it is my role here that remains most vital.  I&#039;m still *the* go-to guy for answers to hardware questions, and while I still do some grunt work around the shop, I am a trainer first and foremost.  New volunteers will always enter the fray, and it&#039;s my job to make sure things not only get done, but also that they are done right.&lt;/p&gt;
