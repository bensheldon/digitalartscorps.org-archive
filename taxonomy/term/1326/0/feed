 <title>Your 1st Month: Organizational Housekeeping</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1805</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;On your first day you should receive a proper orientation to your organization. It should be led by your supervisor and be fairly thorough. It should include everything you will need to know and do to get successfully set-up. Here’s a list of some of the things that you should expect during your orientation/first few weeks at your organization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tour of your facilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal (not email) introductions to organizational staff and volunteers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizational handbook/manual/marketing materials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your own personal desk space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to a computer and internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic office supplies (pens, paper, stapler, paper clips, folders, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Near constant communication with your direct supervisor (until you’re on your feet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not to be treated like a volunteer; you should be treated the same as any other staff member&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting information on the commute to work (directions, tips on short-cuts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get set-up with an email address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downtime? Learn as much as you can!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There can be a lot of downtime during the first few weeks and months of your service. Don’t get frustrated or anxious about it as nearly every VISTA goes through the same process. This early period is a great time for learning all you can about your organization and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some questions, documents, and background information you should be asking about during your first month to get you up to speed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find out about previous, current grants and how your organization is funded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inquire about Board of Directors/Advisory Board structure and who its members are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for your organization’s Mission/Vision statement(s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for an organizational manual if your organization has one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is no organizational manual then ask for an organizational chart that maps out roles and functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for the most recent strategic plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find out about current and past leadership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research all past, current, future programs and projects your organization has been a part of&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review all previous marketing materials, websites, newsletters, brochures, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
