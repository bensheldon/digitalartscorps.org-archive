 <title>Decompressing from the PSO</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/938</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I am back in the office this morning after taking a couple days off from the successful completion of last week&#039;s PSO.  Boston has been baking under 90-plus degree weather and it&#039;s actually comforting to be back in the air-conditioned cave that is  UMass Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the completion of activities from the PSO,  there is still a lot of paperwork to process, evaluations to read and improvements to be documented down for next time.  We&#039;ve ran four PSOs in the last year,  which has kept  the process fresh  in the Project&#039;s mind.  Fortunately for our stress-levels, our next full-PSO won&#039;t happen until next summer; unfortunately, that leaves a lot of time to forget what we&#039;ve learned unless we document it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the Lowell PSO  over, there are a few more VISTAs that will be joining us in  August.  They will be attending the Corporation&#039;s PSO in Providence, RI, which is gentler since the Project won&#039;t be running it, but we&#039;ll still have to orient them to all the CTC VISTA specific info and procedures.  All of the paperwork for those incoming VISTAs is due next week!&lt;/p&gt;
