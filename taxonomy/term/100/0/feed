 <title>My first week as a VISTA</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/109</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello to all! I hope that you are all having fun as a VISTA and that your first week of work has been okay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All is well here in Tennessee. I have been busy working and learning how to do my &amp;quot;job&amp;quot;. So far, I have rewritten the &amp;quot;Volunteer Handbook&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Volunteer Application&amp;quot; for the STAR Center. I have also been able to talk to several people who are interested in volunteering and have scheduled for them to come in for training. In the next week, I will be busy doing trainings, orientation, and tours of the STAR Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also been doing some research for a new adult literacy lab that will be opening (officially) at the end of October. I will need to find several volunteers to run this lab as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if any of you are interested in adult literacy resources, but if you are, I have found some cool websites:   &lt;a href=&quot;http://literacyconnections.com&quot; title=&quot;Literacy Connection&quot;&gt;http://literacyconnections.com/AdultLiteracy.php&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://literacyonline.org&quot; title=&quot;Literacy Online&quot;&gt;http://literacyonline.org&lt;/a&gt;. The first one features several different links, one of which is a newspaper written specifically for new readers.  &lt;/p&gt;
