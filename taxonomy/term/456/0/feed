 <title>Digital Media Updates (Call 01/26 - Working with Youth)</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/371</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This new year brings on a new phase of me being behind on getting y&amp;#39;all together, but here&amp;#39;s to New Year&amp;#39;s resolutions!  I&amp;#39;ll be starting the individual check-in calls tomorrow and hope we can schedule the next conference call for &lt;strong&gt;Friday, January 26th at 2pm EST.&lt;/strong&gt;  At the last call, we had a guest speaker, which seemed to work out well.  There was talk of focusing our next call on youth development and tips for engaging youth in media projects.  I&amp;#39;ll try to get a guest speaker but let me know if there&amp;#39;s anything specific you&amp;#39;re willing to share with the group.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, will the lack of a CTCNet conference this year, we&amp;#39;re a little more open to &lt;strong&gt;attending other conferences.&lt;/strong&gt;  Since your org is required to send you to one, it might be interesting if we find one related to digital media that we could aim for a critical mass of Digital Media CTC VISTAs.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.namac.org/category.cfm?id=1&amp;amp;cid=92&amp;amp;monly=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NAMAC&lt;/a&gt; Conference would be perfect, but it&amp;#39;s not until October 2007.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alliancecm.org/index.php?page_id=106&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alliance for Community Media&lt;/a&gt; conference might only be interesting for folks in cable access stations (July in MN).  Many of the other CTC VISTAs will be going to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nten.org/ntc-register&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NTEN&lt;/a&gt; Conference in April, which may appeal to your techie side...Anyway, I&amp;#39;ll start looking around, but suggestions are welcome!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as I spammed everyone in the general CTC VISTA list, our &lt;strong&gt;guest blogger&lt;/strong&gt; this month will be &lt;strong&gt;Morgan Sully,&lt;/strong&gt; former VISTA and digital media/storytelling guru, so keep an eye on the blogs and get ready to comment and ask him questions galore.  Oh and it wouldn&amp;#39;t hurt to blog some photos or videos of some stuff you&amp;#39;re working on too (according to &lt;a href=&quot;/node/353&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dina&amp;#39;s blog entry&lt;/a&gt;, apparently I need to start bribing everyone with homemade cookies...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS. Thanks to a lovely gift of time from Mr. Ben Sheldon, I&amp;#39;ve got a new personal blog and portfolio up at &lt;a href=&quot;http://verdesmoke.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://verdesmoke.com&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;#39;s mostly for grad school&amp;#39;s to look at for now but soon I hope to be waxing philosophically about life there as well. &lt;/p&gt;
