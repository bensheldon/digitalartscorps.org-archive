 <title>When &quot;Benefits&quot; aren&#039;t enough</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/656</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Anyone out there have one of those pesky &amp;quot;pre-existing conditions&amp;quot; that our benefits prefer not to cover? Well, I did, and it was time to fulfill a prescription (for a measly, oh, $150!) so it came time to find some alternatives! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my doctor turned me on to a &amp;quot;patient assistance&amp;quot; program. Basically, I searched online for the website of the company that manufactures the medication I needed and then sent them an email explaining my financial situation. I received a reply the next day complete with information on patient assistance programs and an application to be completed by my doctor and myself. A completed application, attached tax forms and a month of waiting later and I am happy to say I received a little medical card from the company giving me my prescription for FREE! Booyah! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps anyone out there who might have a similar issue. Good luck! &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Some Notes About Your AmeriCorps Health Benefits</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/510</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;AmeriCorps VISTAs are covered for our health benefits (not insurance!) by &lt;strong&gt;Seven Corners&lt;/strong&gt; ( (866) 699-4186 or &lt;a href=&quot;http://americorps.sevencorners.com&quot;&gt;www.americorps.sevencorners.com&lt;/a&gt;).  Many questions can be answered on their &lt;a href=&quot;http://americorps.sevencorners.com/faq.htm&quot;&gt;FAQs page&lt;/a&gt; or in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://americorps.sevencorners.com/docs/BW_guide06.pdf&quot;&gt;Members Healthcare Guide (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find a doctor (which you should do in the first couple weeks of your service) go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.choicecarenetwork.com/global/Home.asp#&quot; title=&quot;http://www.choicecarenetwork.com/global/Home.asp#&quot;&gt;http://www.choicecarenetwork.com/global/Home.asp#&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;re trying to find out more about your local state run health programs, try starting with your state&#039;s official website...all of which are listed on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firstgov.gov/&quot; title=&quot;http://www.firstgov.gov/&quot;&gt;http://www.firstgov.gov/&lt;/a&gt;.

 <title>Unnecessary (?) adventures - Part II</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/362</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I thought I’d share the final results of my adventures in case anyone was interested.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It helps to know what happened first before reading this Part II, so click &lt;a href=&quot;/node/359&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to get caught up before continuing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ready?&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Okay…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;From work, we (we being Corey &amp;amp; I) left to go back to the first place that we tried in hopes of finding the new location of the clinic.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Upon approaching the door to the place, Corey noticed that the suite number was 150.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Hmmm…150 is supposed to be the suite number for the place I’m looking for.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;105 is the suite number for the children’s clinic.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So we think maybe the numbers got swapped and search unsuccessfully for suite 105.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Seven Corners needs to update their search tool.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I ask the receptionist (a different one this time) about it again, who also asks me how old I am, and later recommends that I try the place I was sent the previous day (stop #2).&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;What to do, what to do…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I try calling the number that I have for this mystery clinic and finally get through to someone to ask where exactly they are located.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I find out that the clinic we’ve been searching for the whole time is the children’s clinic…the two clinics that I thought were separate are the same place!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since I’m not willing to drive almost 30 miles one-way, I decide that it’s time for my last resort.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Time to hit up the hospital emergency room.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Lucky for me, there’s one with-in walking distance only a block from the apartment, so it was easy enough to find.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Not only is it the smallest ER that I’ve seen, but it’s also the most crowded.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I prepare myself for a long night of waiting, reading &lt;em&gt;A Wrinkle in Time&lt;/em&gt; to pass the time until I finally get to see a doctor and get my prescription!&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Almost four hours later, I leave the hospital, swing by CVS (fortunately also within a block), and head home to get some much needed rest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now I’m just keeping my fingers crossed that I don’t get some outrageous bill in the mail for my visit in the near future.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;That would really be the icing on the cake in this chapter of my life story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Unnecessary (?) adventures</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/359</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Being almost four months into my second VISTA term, I&amp;#39;ve never had any trouble utilizing our health benefits...until now.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I&amp;#39;m not an overly-ill person or anything, but I&amp;#39;ve used our benefits a number of times.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;During my trip back to Indiana for the holiday, I managed to pick up a simple head cold (which also happened last time I went home, so I&amp;#39;m trying to determine the correlation).&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Head colds are no biggie at all, but FLYING with one is no picnic.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;As a result, I&amp;#39;ve developed a quite painful ear infection.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;All I need is a prescription for the infection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I wasn&amp;#39;t smart enough to follow the advice from PSO and select a doctor when I initially moved here, I didn&amp;#39;t have the luxury of calling him/her up to schedule a quick appointment to stop by and quickly remedy the problem.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So I thought &amp;quot;Okay, I&amp;#39;ll hop online and use the Seven Corners provider search to find out what Urgent Care Centers I can go to and just do that.&amp;quot;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Never did I imagine it would turn into an adventure.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;My results yielded two care centers, one of which is pediatric only.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;(For comparison purposes, I checked Indianapolis - where I was last year - and got 15 results within a 15 mile radius.)&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I called them up to confirm the information listed to discover that the information was indeed wrong, but no big deal - they just relocated their office to the same location where the children&amp;#39;s care center is located. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left the office a little early so I could beat rush hour traffic and begin my adventure.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We arrived at the address for the care center and ventured inside.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Upon walking in, I noticed that the area was crawling with children (all sick in some way - yuck), so I asked if the clinic served adults.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Nope.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The receptionist asked me how old I was (she probably thought I could have been under 18), so I gave her my answer and she confirmed they couldn&amp;#39;t help me.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I asked her where I could go since I had received information about a care center being located there, and she had no idea what I was talking about.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;She did, however, give me the card for a clinic located one block north and advised me to try there.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;On to stop #2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made the short trip to the second clinic and walked in, ready and prepared to be served.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;While signing in, the receptionist asked me if I had an appointment, to which I responded &amp;quot;no.&amp;quot;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;(I didn&amp;#39;t think you needed appointments at urgent care centers?)&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Turns out I couldn&amp;#39;t be seen because I didn&amp;#39;t have an appointment.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;She was nice enough, however, to give me a list of clinics that I could try to see if I had better luck elsewhere.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Moving on... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before going anywhere, I tried calling some of the clinics on the sheet, only to discover that most required appointments to be seen.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;(At that point, I wasn&amp;#39;t even thinking about the issue of whether Seven Corners would cover my expenses or not.)&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Since it was nearing 5:00 by then, we gave up and went grocery shopping so we could restock our kitchen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at Ralph’s, I explained my situation to the pharmacist and asked if he could provide any advise.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;He told me about an urgent care center not far from where we were, although he couldn&amp;#39;t tell me an exact name or address.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Upon arriving home, I went to search for it on the internet, with no luck.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I did, however, have luck finding a place just one block from the apartment that was open until 7:00.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It was 6:17;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I still had time to make it before it closed.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a quick walk across the street, and found the place.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot;This is it!&amp;quot;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I thought.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But nope, I was wrong.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The receptionist informed me that she couldn&amp;#39;t verify my &amp;quot;insurance&amp;quot; so I would have to be responsible for any charges for the visit until I could find out if they would be covered.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;How much?&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot;At least $175, but could be $250 or more.&amp;quot; &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Too much.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I left frustrated and in awe of how complicated this had become.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I would have given up by now and just waited out the infection were it not for the fact that it&amp;#39;s one of the most painful ones I&amp;#39;ve had in a while.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I wake up at night in pain and am constantly reminded of it throughout the day.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So I wasn&amp;#39;t ready to give up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, I called Seven Corners to find out if they covered any other places that weren&amp;#39;t listed online, specifically the place I had tried the night before.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;In a nutshell, the response given to me was &amp;quot;If it&amp;#39;s not online, it&amp;#39;s not covered.&amp;quot;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I mentioned that I had tried the only place listed that I could go with no luck, to which I got, &amp;quot;If there is no where in a 35-mile radius of where you are, you can go anywhere.&amp;quot;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Oh.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So I expanded my search to 40 miles (35 wasn&amp;#39;t an option).&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I discovered that there are three places all between 26-27 miles from me...but that&amp;#39;s one way and not exactly close.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In an act of desperation, I tried calling the original place again to re-listen to the recording and noticed the suite number given with the address - 150.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Interesting...the suite number for the children&amp;#39;s clinic (in the same building) is 105.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But you would think they would know about it and would have told me about it when I initially asked...but apparently not.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So today after work, I&amp;#39;m going to try going back to the first building we tried to try to find the clinic.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Wish me luck!!&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m going to do if this doesn&amp;#39;t work out...maybe I&amp;#39;m just spoiled.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>VISTA Health Benefits - Seven Corners</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/118</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americorps.sevencorners.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://americorps.sevencorners.com/pics/7c_logo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Seven Corners Logo&quot; title=&quot;Seven Corners Logo&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;66&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you have any questions about the Americorps VISTA health BENEFITS (not insurance), check out the Seven Corner&amp;#39;s website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://americorps.sevencorners.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Seven Corners&quot;&gt;http://americorps.sevencorners.com&lt;/a&gt; or call 1-866-699-4186.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, your questions will probably be very specific and better answered by those folks than me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The info on MassHealth benefits are available online as well at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eohhs2agencylanding&amp;amp;L=4&amp;amp;L0=Home&amp;amp;L1=Government&amp;amp;L2=Departments+and+Divisions&amp;amp;L3=MassHealth&amp;amp;sid=Eeohhs2&quot; title=&quot;Mass Health on Mass.gov&quot;&gt;http://www.mass.gov&lt;/a&gt;.  If you&amp;#39;re trying to find out more about your local state run health programs, try starting with your state&amp;#39;s offical website...all of which are listed on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firstgov.gov/Agencies/State_and_Territories.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Firstgov.gov State site listing&quot;&gt;http://www.firstgov.gov/&lt;/a&gt;.  Look for links to &lt;strong&gt;Health&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Best advice, stay healthy! Drink your OJ and go for walks! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>vista life stuff...</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/89</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;i really hope we all keep up with our blogs, because &lt;strong&gt;i want to be able to keep up with all of you!&lt;/strong&gt; ok, now for some &amp;quot;vista life&amp;quot; type stuff i&amp;#39;ve been thinking about / looking into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   *** food stamps ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  according to stuff online, i don&amp;#39;t think i am eligible for food stamps since i have too much savings (too much being more than the limit of $2,000). savings in an ira must be included toward this limit, even though according to wikipedia &amp;quot;a debtor in bankruptcy can exempt his or her IRA from the bankruptcy estate&amp;quot; and this seems like it should be a similar situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  also, higher rent payments (after a certain amount that it is assumed you can pay) leads to being eligible for a higher amount of food stamps. this makes sense in a way -- after all, sometimes (depending on where one&amp;#39;s job is) one can&amp;#39;t help but get an expensive apartment. but on the other hand, sometimes one can choose between more expensive apartments that are bigger/more convenient/newer and less expensive apartments that aren&amp;#39;t. it seems that one shouldn&amp;#39;t get more food stamps just because one&amp;#39;s rent is higher -- it should depend on other factors such as the average apartment rent in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  anyway, though it would have been nice to be able to get better/more food, i am glad i am not eligible for food stamps because i think if i were it would be hard for me to not get them. and i am not sure i think getting food stamps is the moral thing for me to do since i can live decently without them. actually, this is a question i struggle with a lot: &lt;strong&gt;how much unnecessary stuff must one have/buy before it is wrong? what do you guys think?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   *** health &lt;em&gt;benefits&lt;/em&gt; ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  does anyone else think it is strange that we won&amp;#39;t get our health benefit cards for a while (what was it, 4-6 weeks)? i think we should at least get our member numbers and stuff like that right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  i was looking through the guide to the health plan, and some of the stuff was kinda weird. there are a number of treatments that are not covered by the plan even if they were not preexisting, such as narcolepsy and add and aids medicines. i don&amp;#39;t expect these omissions to be a problem for me personally, but &lt;strong&gt;i wonder how they decide things like that&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  one of the &amp;quot;exclusions to covered services&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;Any services related to the treatment of allergies including allergy tests and surveys, injection, medication and treatment (except for emergency treatment including medication and hospitalization for asthma)&amp;quot;. so recently i&amp;#39;ve been having this itching in my ears that i think is caused by allergies but for all i know it could actually be caused by some weird ear disease. if i go to the doctor and then they decide it is caused by allergies, will the health plan not cover the doctor visit even though i didn&amp;#39;t know it was allergies at first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   *** cheap stuff ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  for getting things cheaply or even for free, check out the websites &lt;strong&gt;craigslist and freecycle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   you guys are &lt;strong&gt;great&lt;/strong&gt; and i hope you have great first days.&lt;/p&gt;
