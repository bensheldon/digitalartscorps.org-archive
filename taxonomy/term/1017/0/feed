 <title>The goings on at Appalshop</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1390</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Things are going much more smoothly around here since my last post/our last small group phone conversation.  This is what is new:&lt;br /&gt;
-we got our Facilitation Guide printed and it&#039;s super pretty and is drawing a lot of attention!&lt;br /&gt;
-StoryLine, the web based story gathering project I&#039;m doing has really begun to hit the ground running. We&#039;re getting calls into the skype line every week and I put them up on the website.  I&#039;ve also developed a partnership for Thousand Kites with the Guild of Outsider Writers. They are an online community of writers and are volunteering to read/record the poems we get from folks in the prisons. It&#039;s great.&lt;br /&gt;
(this is my big project, so it&#039;s exciting that it&#039;s actually going somewhere) People are starting to comment on the pieces, too, which is the goal.&lt;br /&gt;
-I was invited to attend a convening of grantees of the Nathan Cummings Foundation in NYC last week. With about 20 other organizations my boss Nick and I spoke about Appalshop and Thousand Kites and got to share ideas. I felt fairly young and inexperienced there, but it was a fantastic learning experience and I met some wonderful people in the art/social justice field.&lt;br /&gt;
-This weekend the gathering continued in Whitesburg when we brought 10 funders to come hang out here. It was wonderful. Yay fundraising strategies!&lt;br /&gt;
-next up is our big Calls From Home annual holiday call in radio show, which I&#039;m doing a ton of outreach and organizing for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super busy time right now. It finally feels really good to be here.&lt;/p&gt;
