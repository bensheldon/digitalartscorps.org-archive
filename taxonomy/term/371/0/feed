 <description>&lt;p&gt;hello from san francisco.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; it has been almost 3 weeks since my boss left and there is still no permanent new hire in sight.  currently, my ex-boss&amp;#39;s niece is filling her position but i think it is only until the end of the year.  it is strange to automatically fill such a huge role in the organization.  i am now teaching a technology class to the community health workers on staff and going full speed ahead on website reworking.  everything is finally settling back down and the only huge obstacle is my lack of proficiency in spanish.  when i am the only person in the lab (which does happen often now) and a spanish speaker comes in i feel so useless.  my spanish skills, however, are rapidly improving.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; it turns out that there is a free &amp;quot;website makeover&amp;quot; happening this weekend that i was invited to.  a bunch of drupal experts will be there to help orgs convert their websites over to drupal.  this is really exciting to me because i have felt less confident doing it on my own.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; also, i attended the sf wifi conference last friday and met a new ctc vista named &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nten.org/staff&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;karl hedstrom&lt;/a&gt; at nten.  although i thought the conference was a bit of a bust, i did link up with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bavc.org&quot;&gt;bay area video coalition&lt;/a&gt; (amazing organization), see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aspirationtech.org/blog/heather&quot;&gt;heather&lt;/a&gt; from aspiration tech and a network with couple of other new bay area non-profit technology people.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; to top it all off, fellow ctc vista rebecca white and i ate some amazing vegan japanese food in the mission on monday night.  although it was pouring down rain, the hot soup and tea totally made my night. &lt;/p&gt;
