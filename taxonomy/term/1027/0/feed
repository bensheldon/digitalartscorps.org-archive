 <title>The end of an Era</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1404</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well...it seems just like that my Vista life is over. My 2 years kinda flew by. I learned so much I can&#039;t even imagine where to start. Along with tons of software, I also had numerous chances to practice public speaking, attend business meetings on behalf of the company, and interact with all types of diverse &amp;amp; fascinating people. I suppose that&#039;s what I&#039;m most thankful for. Also, I&#039;ve becoming an expert on stretching my dollar-lol &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    A lot of my time here at The Media Aid Center has been consumed by building and updating our website mediaaidcenter.org It&#039;s a shame that I&#039;m just now getting a handle on the whole process, but it takes twice as long when you have high school students in the room who need attention. An important rule I&#039;ve learned this yr as far as programming &amp;amp; design is &quot;don&#039;t reinvent the wheel&quot; ! If there&#039;s a 3rd part app or excellent tutorial on a related subject matter, use it ! I mad the mistake of approaching things as if it had never been done before &amp;amp; I had to rely on myself.&lt;br /&gt;
     My time here has been pretty smooth. My boss is an excellent communicator and always kept a casual and encouraging atmosphere. If money was no issue, I&#039;d probably stay here longer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     I&#039;ll be using my two educational stipends to attend an audio school here in the LA/ Hollywood area early next year. I&#039;ll also have the time to better focus on my new hobby/website Fantastic Disaster Poetry at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fdp.me&quot; title=&quot;www.fdp.me&quot;&gt;www.fdp.me&lt;/a&gt; (shameless plug). I&#039;d like to thank everyone involved in making this program work. The conferences were great, I always got paid on time, and the leaders always showed passion for what they do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Oh and to new Vistas, never make a separate Vista email folder &amp;amp; filter to automatically sort emails. You&#039;ll forget to check it for months on in such as myself and not receive important training/conference info on time!&lt;/p&gt;
