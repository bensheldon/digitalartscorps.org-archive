 <title>VISTA Testimonials: Food Stamps</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1759</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is a list of testimonials of past VISTAs on their experience with Food Stamps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DASCorps serving in the Bay Area:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went into the ruckus of Alameda County Social Services (I say ruckus because there was a fight, but I digress) the process went very well and I even qualified for Expedited services. The woman there told me that my Americorps income didn&#039;t count necessarily but once it&#039;s in my checking or savings account it counts as liquid asset, she told me that when it&#039;s time for my second meeting to make sure my current bank statement didn&#039;t have my Americorps stipend in it or it could affect the amount I get every month. thought maybe that would help some folk out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DASCorps serving in California:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applied for food stamps yesterday, and it did not go well.  I provided my substitute in-service letter signed by Ben to my case worker here in San Diego, and I was almost denied immediately because my monthly stipend was higher than the income allowed for food stamps. This should not make a difference because our stipends are exempt from being considered income for this type of assistance. After talking to her supervisor, she returned and grilled me asking how I supported myself in NY.  I told her how I was working just below my apartment 20 hours a week at a restaurant, and food stamps were unnecessary.  She said the fact that I quit my job for &#039;no good reason&#039; would deny me food stamps and it create a 90-day window before I could receive them if I did happen to apply again in thirty days. She never heard of Americorps before.  Her supervisor had to look it up.  It was not a fun time but I&#039;m going to try again next week.  I&#039;m guessing I should go to the state offices to re-approach this situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DASCorps serving in Illinois:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience has been less intense but equally shitty: I received a letter for my food stamps appointment on the day of the appointment ... after the scheduled time of the appointment. Also, although you apply electronically and give them yr email &amp;amp; phone number, they don&#039;t call or email you your appt time. No, they write you a letter. I mean, what is this, 1917? Maybe they&#039;ll alert me of my appt by Wells Fargo wagon next time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I&#039;ve been calling them every day on the half-hour, and I get one of two responses:&lt;br /&gt;
1. A busy signal&lt;br /&gt;
2. &quot;Hello, you&#039;ve reached the Champaign County Department of Community Resources. Our offices are currently closed ...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m going to head in there tomorrow and give them the ol&#039; one-two. Good luck everyone. These are the Kafkian days of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DASCorps serving in Louisiana:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying for them wasn&#039;t that big of a deal, and it turns out that doing mine on paper and sending it in worked faster than either taking the forms in to the office itself or faxing them in, which my roommates tried to do. I got a call back within a couple of days, and after them making sure that I actually didn&#039;t make a lot of money, I received the card and had a couple of months of much better eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I got the mid-term evaluation sort of thing, which I filled out and sent back in. They didn&#039;t like something about it, though, and sent me a letter requesting 4 of my last paycheck stubs. I looked, and unfortunately had misplaced one of the last 4, so I called to see if I could replace it with another one. After trying five different numbers, I was finally directed to my case worker, who refused to tell me over the phone if sending in a different stub would be OK, and generally seemed to question my qualifications for foodstamps. I finally just said, fine, I&#039;ll write a note explaining my situation, and sent in my last 3 stubs pluse another one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next month, the foodstamps didn&#039;t renew. I tried calling the office for two days, in which I either got a busy signal or transfered to a line that rang forever. I went to their website and sent them an email, just asking what was going on and what I had to do to convince them I needed foodstamps.&lt;br /&gt;
Within two hours, I got a call saying that my case had been reopened and the stamps would be updated the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, sorry for the length, but the moral of my story was 1: keep track of all of your paystubs! and 2: try as many different ways to get in touch with the office. I&#039;m hoping I won&#039;t have to do it all again, but its definitely a nice addition to your income that&#039;s worth a little inconvenience. The experience has made me wonder how people actually get on and keep these benefits, especially if they don&#039;t have ready access to phones, computers, email, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DASCorps serving in Fresno:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on experience in Fresno (which seems to run it&#039;s food stamps office better than anywhere else in CA somehow) you can send the forms back late and no one really cares. Also sending your income letter and the &quot;this doesn&#039;t count as income&quot; letter Ben just sent out in with your quarterly report is important. It just keeps confusion to a minimum,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way, I&#039;ve found, to get things done at food stamps offices (in both Fresno and now Sacramento) is to come with ALL your shit (birth certificate, SS card, the income letter and the other letter Ben just sent out, proof of residency, and bank statements) ideally a half hour before the office opens and get in line (and there will be a line). Bring a book or an ipod or something to entertain yourself and hurry up and wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling or trying to email is pointless. They aren&#039;t set up to deal with it. Different story once you have a caseworker, but before then you might as well try talking to a wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fresno office took around 40 minutes to get everything done. The Sacramento office took 8+ hours over two days. Just resign yourself to a series of Job-like trials and tell your boss you&#039;ll be in when they free you.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Mopeds and web stuffs</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1614</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Whoops, it&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve done one of these things. So my car was unable to pass smog and I&#039;m currently trying to get the guy who sold it to me to give me my money back and he&#039;s dodging my calls. Thankfully my boss knows someone in Marin (where I got it) who used to do lemon law stuff and now does legal aid, so hopefully she can put the fear of God in him. But now I have a moped, which is exciting and insurance is only $9 a month, so you can&#039;t beat that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project-wise things are still in early stages yet. I&#039;m looking at applications to hire a programmer for one of our sites (californiavoices.org if you know anyone who&#039;s good at Ruby on Rails and wants a low paying job you can send them my way). And moving the rest of them around so that they all are on joomla instead of a mix of random CMSes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like up until this point there hasn&#039;t been much standardization in the way they do web things. Everything is in different languages, hosted by different people in different places. So it&#039;s a little crazy making, but I&#039;m slowly trying to pull everything together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I haven&#039;t had the food stamps issues a lot of people seem to be. Other than my mail seems to be super super slow so I got a letter the other day saying that because I hadn&#039;t turned something in they were going to cut me off, but when I called they said they&#039;d gotten the paper work.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Drupal and HTMLing</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/438</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;On the first week with DANEnet, and now I&amp;#39;m relearning everything I once knew about HTML and then some!  I&amp;#39;m also going to be administrating some sites using Drupal, so if anyone here uses Drupal and would be a good resource, it would be great if I could throw questions at you if I needed it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And I have my meeting for food stamps on February 7th!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Also, to clarify, is there NO CTC conference this year?  And what are the exact dates of the NTEN conference in DC?  Let me know, thanks! &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>ZZZzzzzz.....wha?</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/140</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow...I&amp;#39;m glad everybody seems to be having a super-fun time in San Diego.   I&amp;#39;ve spent the whole week updating 16 iBooks, using only a single installation disc, and a slow internet connection.  fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Also, I finally got around to applying for food stamps.  I&amp;#39;m not sure how much they are giving me, but it&amp;#39;s not going to be as much as I had hoped.  It turns out that if I had applied BEFORE the PSO, none of my &amp;quot;living stipend&amp;quot; would count as income, but having applied after my term of service began, it all counts as income.  Making me poor, but not poor enough.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, as part of my work, I am researching digital distribution, and all kinds of crazy internet-y type stuff, so I decided to start my own vlog to get some hands-on experience.  If you want to check it out, go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kirstenacademy.blogspot.com&quot; title=&quot;www.kirstenacademy.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;www.kirstenacademy.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;       There won&amp;#39;t be any video clips until next week though. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>first two and a half weeks</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/137</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;#39;ve been here two and a half weeks now; it feels so normal now that I&amp;#39;m wondering what to say about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get the impression that my organization (the California Coalition for Rural Housing, CCRH) is very different from most of the others. We&amp;#39;re a suite of offices rather than a community center, and I haven&amp;#39;t yet had any contact with the population we serve. Scratch that; our audience is the affordable housing community, rather than individuals. We work with groups like other affordable housing nonprofits, town governments, lobbyist groups, and tenants&amp;#39; associations. So in terms of the people aspects of our work, sitting in on conference calls and going to meetings is where it&amp;#39;s at (though hopefully I will be involved in some GIS trainings later in my service).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty much treated like a regular employee here; my title is &amp;quot;Community Technology Specialist&amp;quot; &amp;lt;brag&amp;gt;and I&amp;#39;ve got business cards to prove it.&amp;lt;/brag&amp;gt; I&amp;#39;ve got an office with a desk, filing cabinets, and a computer, though I generally use my own because I&amp;#39;m more comfortable with its tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first few days I met everyone who works here (or five of the six; Rob was out of town) and talked to them about what they work on. I read a few grants, and sat in on some meetings. And then my supervisor Darryl and I started talking about the website, which is my priority right now. It&amp;#39;s currently a jumble of static html pages, most of which are broken and out of date. I&amp;#39;m really excited about the ideas behind the redesign, and I&amp;#39;ll definitely be blogging about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I went to apply for &lt;a href=&quot;http://circuitous.org/rebecca/2006/09/25/monday-paperwork/&quot;&gt;food stamps on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. For Californians on food stamps: there&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;customer service&amp;quot; number on the back of the EBT card; to talk to a person when you call that, don&amp;#39;t enter your card number when prompted, just press #. And then press it again when it prompts you again. I was suprised that noone gave me any information on what I can and can&amp;#39;t buy with food stamps, or a list of local stores that accept them, but supposedly I can get those questions answered at that customer service number. (Since when are we &amp;quot;customers&amp;quot; of the government...?)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Inexpensive Food Resource</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/107</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Since living cheaply is a concern for us, I thought I would share this resource that was shared with me.  Since there appear to be a few of you that, for many different reasons, don&amp;#39;t qualify for food stamps, there is a group called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.angelfoodministries.com/&quot; title=&quot;Angel Food Ministries&quot;&gt;Angel Food Ministries&lt;/a&gt; that has no income verification and anyone can purchase their boxes of food.  If you read the About Us page, it tells how they got started and what the boxes of groceries typically contain.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It looks as though there are locations all over the U.S. so take a look and see if there is something in your area.  The menu is posted for October and changes every month.  The only catch is that you have to pay for your groceries approximately 2 weeks before you can pick them up, but for $25, who cares about the wait!!  There are add on packs for $18 each month that change as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you that do receive food stamps, they accept those as well, so you can get more bang for your food stamp buck. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>vista life stuff...</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/89</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;i really hope we all keep up with our blogs, because &lt;strong&gt;i want to be able to keep up with all of you!&lt;/strong&gt; ok, now for some &amp;quot;vista life&amp;quot; type stuff i&amp;#39;ve been thinking about / looking into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   *** food stamps ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  according to stuff online, i don&amp;#39;t think i am eligible for food stamps since i have too much savings (too much being more than the limit of $2,000). savings in an ira must be included toward this limit, even though according to wikipedia &amp;quot;a debtor in bankruptcy can exempt his or her IRA from the bankruptcy estate&amp;quot; and this seems like it should be a similar situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  also, higher rent payments (after a certain amount that it is assumed you can pay) leads to being eligible for a higher amount of food stamps. this makes sense in a way -- after all, sometimes (depending on where one&amp;#39;s job is) one can&amp;#39;t help but get an expensive apartment. but on the other hand, sometimes one can choose between more expensive apartments that are bigger/more convenient/newer and less expensive apartments that aren&amp;#39;t. it seems that one shouldn&amp;#39;t get more food stamps just because one&amp;#39;s rent is higher -- it should depend on other factors such as the average apartment rent in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  anyway, though it would have been nice to be able to get better/more food, i am glad i am not eligible for food stamps because i think if i were it would be hard for me to not get them. and i am not sure i think getting food stamps is the moral thing for me to do since i can live decently without them. actually, this is a question i struggle with a lot: &lt;strong&gt;how much unnecessary stuff must one have/buy before it is wrong? what do you guys think?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   *** health &lt;em&gt;benefits&lt;/em&gt; ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  does anyone else think it is strange that we won&amp;#39;t get our health benefit cards for a while (what was it, 4-6 weeks)? i think we should at least get our member numbers and stuff like that right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  i was looking through the guide to the health plan, and some of the stuff was kinda weird. there are a number of treatments that are not covered by the plan even if they were not preexisting, such as narcolepsy and add and aids medicines. i don&amp;#39;t expect these omissions to be a problem for me personally, but &lt;strong&gt;i wonder how they decide things like that&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  one of the &amp;quot;exclusions to covered services&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;Any services related to the treatment of allergies including allergy tests and surveys, injection, medication and treatment (except for emergency treatment including medication and hospitalization for asthma)&amp;quot;. so recently i&amp;#39;ve been having this itching in my ears that i think is caused by allergies but for all i know it could actually be caused by some weird ear disease. if i go to the doctor and then they decide it is caused by allergies, will the health plan not cover the doctor visit even though i didn&amp;#39;t know it was allergies at first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   *** cheap stuff ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  for getting things cheaply or even for free, check out the websites &lt;strong&gt;craigslist and freecycle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   you guys are &lt;strong&gt;great&lt;/strong&gt; and i hope you have great first days.&lt;/p&gt;
