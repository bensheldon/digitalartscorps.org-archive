 <title>Volunteer Management SWOT analysis</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/609</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first (and possibly only) meeting of the Volunteer Management working group that was held at the June 2007 DASCorps Pre-Service Orientation went through a basic SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis using collective experience for organizing and implementing a Volunteer Program. The following is the SWOT list generated from that meeting. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengths: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Organization&lt;br /&gt;
- Leadership&lt;br /&gt;
- Understanding People (Emotional Intelligence)&lt;br /&gt;
- Solid Communication&lt;br /&gt;
- Protocols&lt;br /&gt;
- Assessments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weaknesses: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- too much idealism/unreasonable expectations&lt;br /&gt;
- Poor communication&lt;br /&gt;
- Unclear Chain of Command&lt;br /&gt;
- Lack of volunteer recognition&lt;br /&gt;
- Lack of ground rules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Previous volunteers/Alumni&lt;br /&gt;
- Networking&lt;br /&gt;
- College volunteer centers/student service organizations&lt;br /&gt;
- Senior organizations&lt;br /&gt;
- Community Centers&lt;br /&gt;
- Online volunteer sites (craigslist.com, volunteermatch.com, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threats: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Absence of Shared Vision/People not understanding volunteerism&lt;br /&gt;
Size of organizations (both a large and well-known organization where people assume a large contingent of volunteers where they may actually be few or a small organization that is not well-known enough to gain volunteers&#039; interest/trust)&lt;br /&gt;
- Recruiting qualified volunteers&lt;br /&gt;
- Lack of interest&lt;br /&gt;
- Bad timing of recruitment (i.e. volunteer recruitment at college level mid-way through semester)&lt;br /&gt;
- Transportation availability/affordability for volunteers to travel to work site&lt;br /&gt;
- Excuses, people saying &quot;I already gave too much&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
- Public knowledge of how to get involved with volunteering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volunteer Management working group aims to address all these issues and more in its final output. Keep posted for more information and resources as they are added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sample Volunteer Management plan/handbook is attached below. It was developed for HOME, Inc. in January 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, take a look at another Volunteer Management handbook, also listed below, created by our own VISTA!&lt;/p&gt;
