 <title>Frustrated</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1082</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&#039;ve been here for a couple months and right now I&#039;m working on volunteer coordination. I&#039;m trying to help community computer labs increase their productivity by helping them not only recruit volunteers but develop orientations and training to retain them. This all sounds very well and good, but so far we&#039;ve had a hard time getting coorporation from non-profits. Now don&#039;t get me wrong, there is a definite need here in Miami, non-profits are by no means working at their full capacity. They are for the most parts the same as non-profits everywhere else -- overwork and understaffed. But still, although we&#039;re offering them free services and guranteeing to do all of their legwork, these non-profits don&#039;t want to cooperate. I&#039;m left practically stalking them (and I know they&#039;re screening my calls at this point) to try to give them something I know they need. What am I doing wrong here? How can we develop an effective network of volunteers and agencies? I&#039;d love some suggestions here.&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks&lt;br /&gt;
~Vic&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Fundraising not so blues??</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/972</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It is half way through our Summer Day Camp here in Tempe and we are super busy with kids here for 11 hours a day.  I had to put my fundraising on hold for a bit.  We were able to get 500 dollars, which I thought was my ceiling for my fundraising.  It turned out to be more in the 700 dollar range.  I got a new Computer Lab staff and he has being doing wonderfully with the kids.  He has them building bridges with freeware software, shooting videos, learning about the environment, and all around just keeping the children engaged during a time of year which can be very hard.  A couple of our teens attended a pilot program of ours called High Tech U.  This is an oppurtunity for the kids to experiance some of the technology field with tours of local factories and learning hands on how to make silicon chips.  It is an excellent opportunity for our teens to experiance some careers that might be available for them after they are finished with their education.&lt;/p&gt;
