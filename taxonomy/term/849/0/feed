 <description>&lt;p&gt;Right now I&#039;m doing the legwork for a grant that will allow us to build a social networking site between different computer labs. We  don&#039;t really need a grant to do this, if we don&#039;t get it we&#039;ll use the templete off Ning, but we&#039;d prefer to get the grant and use the money towards hiring a professional web designer and publicity events for the website. I&#039;m excited about the social network because in my work researching different CTC&#039;s it seems as though the kids want to go on social networking sites like MYSPACE but with the questionable security procedures lab administrators (very rightly so) are barring these websites. OUr website will allow children in computers labs across Miami-Dade county to connect with each other. In addition it&#039;ll be a great place for them to discuss what computer projects they&#039;re working on as well as posting them up. In the future i&#039;d like to expand this website to include the personelle of different non-profit computer labs, as a forum where they can discuss grant strategies, volunteer recruitment etc. I&#039;d even like to add a space where volunteers and agencies can connect (similar to volunteer.com or something). So I&#039;ve got a lot of plans for our website but the most important thing now is making sure we get the buy-in from different computer labs. Because it doesn&#039;t matter how amazing I think this website is if no one uses it. If we get the grant money, then we can throw pizza parties and cute little events that will further encourage these computer labs to use our website as a resource.&lt;br /&gt;
Not related, but in addition, I am very excited to get Kevin as my new Vista Leader, he helped me with volunteer coordinating and it&#039;ll be fun to work with him more regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
