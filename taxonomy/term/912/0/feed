 <title>Update</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1224</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So long time no write, I guess I haven&#039;t updated in a while. Anyway in the last few months we threw our first Breakfast Blastoff Conference in January. We had a great showing, including the local program director for the Knight Foundation (who we&#039;re having another meeting with next week). It was really exciting to get the separate agencies together, and a few agencies have even started working together on separate projects. Since the success of that meeting we&#039;ve been working on a couple follow-up meetings. First one that will be devoted to helping the separate agencies as a resource in building curriculum, and then another meeting to educate these agencies, and see how they can get involved with, the Knight Foundation&#039;s $4.5 milliion dollar Universal Access Initiative. Anyway I have a conference call today so I&#039;ll talk with all of you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~Vic&lt;/p&gt;
