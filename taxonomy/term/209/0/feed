 <title>Background Checks</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/208</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Does anyoneknow how one goes about doing a background check?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a guy come in to volunteer a while ago, and he seemed okay. but until that point we hadn&amp;#39;t had anyone come with us that the MoLLIE supervisor didn&amp;#39;t know. Everyone had already worked with MoLLIE before. And for some reason, Jeanne and I thought the same thing at the same time after he left, &amp;#39;what do we really now about this guy?&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was surprising to me that in 5 years, the idea of doing background checks on people had not occured to those running a program that works regularly with children. That&amp;#39;s like a no brainer, right? There&amp;#39;s laws about this sort of thing, right? Well, from now on we are going to do checks on employees and volunteers, we just have to figure out how. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no one here knows anything about how to do background checks. I did some looking online a few weeks ago. You get dozens of sites claiming to do background checks. On several of them I checked myself. And though I didn&amp;#39;t give my social security number, the sites could have still done better. most of the info was wrong, stating that I had lived in several cities that I have not, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeanne is gone for most of the week helping her father in Florida. She asked me to try to figure the background check issue while she was gone. I&amp;#39;m not sure where to look. the proliferation of such sites online make it hard to determine which, if any, are on the level. So if anyone has suggestions, I&amp;#39;d love to hear from you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich &lt;/p&gt;
