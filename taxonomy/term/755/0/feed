 <title>What&#039;s new with me</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/937</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of u are tired of reading all of my posts since I do em so often (every 3months-lol) but here I am. Since last time I&#039;ve gotten a much better handle on web site building though I still have much to learn. I finished the company site a few weeks ago and are just waiting for the go-ahead to publish it to the web.  I&#039;ve mostly been gearing up for the summer where we&#039;ll start to have regular classes with students. This is where I&#039;ll be getting all my footage and interviews from which to post on our site and future Kiosk  network. The Kiosk network will consist of free access computer terminals listing a directory of community resources for ppl without computers or internet access at home). I really enjoy the whole planning and strategical process involved with these plans. How uber exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
