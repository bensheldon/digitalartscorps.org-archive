 <title>Intel Computer Clubhouse Conference</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/810</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;  &lt;span&gt;The Intel Computer Clubhouse conference is a time for Clubhouse Coordinators, Assistants, Executive Directors, and Staff within the network to reconnect and be inspired within their perspective clubhouses.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This year the windy city was honored to host the Annual Intel Computer Clubhouse Conference from April 23-27, 2007 at the Orrington Hotel in Evanston. Individuals worldwide, from South Africa to Latin America to the Middle East had a chance to visit our wonderful city. They were able to experience Chicago’s diverse cultures and visit the neighbors where the four Intel Comput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;er Clubhouses are located: WYTEC (West Garfield), ABJ Community Center (Southside), The Zone HACC (Rogers Park), and Austin YMCA (Austin).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The 2007 theme was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moving Beyond Four Walls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Attendees showed the connection and collaboration between clubhouses nationwide by showcase a youth video boomerang that bounced from Atlanta to Chicago to Virginia to Miami. Preparations were also made for regional teen summits where teens from Detroit, Chicago, and Missouri will have a chance to work together on collaborative projects. The 2007 conference was truly inspiring beyond the clubhouse walls.&lt;span&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Suiting up for Intel Computer Clubhouse Annual Conference</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/724</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In March of 2006, the Intel Computer Clubhouse Annual Conference was held in Mexico City, Mexico.  I had been involved with WYTEC Clubhouse in Chicago for about 6 months during that time and was still familiarizing myself with the technoloy as well as the learning model of the clubhouse.  Last year&amp;#39;s conference exposed me to new people and creative ideas to implement at my clubhouse, from Flash animation ideas to using a Green Screen in digital photography and video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I am pleased to learn that the annual Intel Computer Clubhouse Conference in 2007 will be here in Chicago.  This conference will give me an opportuinity to reconnect with the individuals I met last year as well as share creative ideas and learn software I am not too familiar with.  &lt;/p&gt;
