 <description>&lt;p&gt;hello there ctc vista project.  things here at homeless prenatal are going right along-- i&#039;m unofficially the interim technology manager.  this means that i have been doing insane amounts of troubleshooting and teaching for both clients and staff.  in addition to managing the lab, i have also been working on creating policies and procedures, technology user guides and new website content as well as organizing the file server.  most of the guides are in the revisions process, so any suggestions for resources would be greatly appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;since my last post, i have had the opportunity to attend a couple of workshops including: one at the center for digital storytelling with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctcvista.org/user/968&quot;&gt;jessica&lt;/a&gt;, a drupal dream makeover course, an adobe interactive forms course and soon another photoshop course!  if you are interested, i can review and recommend (or not  recommend) the courses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; today i had lunch with the lovely &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctcvista.org/user/813&quot;&gt;morgan sully&lt;/a&gt; at my favorite little &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/biz/uGM7PAmP2utWXjYcZkVpQQ&quot;&gt;taco truck&lt;/a&gt; in the mission.  thank you $3 lunch. being with other vistas is quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>master troubleshooter should be my VISTA title </title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/321</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m not sure if i have talked with anyone about this, but two weeks ago (i cannot believe how much time has gone by already) i went to an drupal extreme makeover.  basically, i was feed for two days and taught the ins and outs of drupal. well, i was taught as much as you can learn in a crash course.  i was also able to  work one-on-one with a drupal expert to start the revision of our extremely outdated helping-sf. it was an amazing experience (&amp;amp; free for our organization too!)  in the past two weeks, however, i have had about zero time to work on the website.  this drives me crazy.  currently, i am teaching class, helping in the technology center, doing general tech support for the office (meaning about 20 phone calls a day) and being a lead interviewer for my new boss (what?!?).  i feel as though there is no time to actually work on the projects that i feel i was hired for.  my job title would be more accurately stated as &amp;quot;master troubleshooter&amp;quot;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oohh. i hear the phone-- another access database questions i am sure.  &lt;/p&gt;
