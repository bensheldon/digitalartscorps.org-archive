 <title>VISTA&#039;s working together</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/367</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This past week I took some time off and went to visit my friends, Darrin and Courtney in Cincinnati Ohio. Before I left I let Lauren Bratslavsky at Media Bridges know that I&amp;#39;d be in town., so that we could possibly get together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few emails and phone calls Lauren and I decided to meet Friday at Media Bridges at 12:30. I walked in and really liked the building. It&amp;#39;s one of these refurbished old buildings and just has a neat look. Lauren met me and showed me around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They recently got new iMacs for their edit suites and such. They were smart enough to make sure they had DVD burners. Unlike the new mini editing lab here at the CMC. Over all I was impressed by the facility and the people I met. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that they have a second VISTA, Kathy Dumas, there as well. The three of us walked to a Deli for lunch. We had a spirit discussion about being a VISTA, problems facing Community Media, patriarchy, lax direction, and other stuff. It seems that VISTA&amp;#39;s at Media Bridges do not get made to feel like they are part of the staff, as I do here in Grand Rapids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch we returned to Media Bridges. One thing we talked about was the program Garageband. I had put together a tutorial on it and they had some questions about it. So we went upstairs and I gave them an overview of how the program works. We made a little VISTA music piece. It is rather odd. lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren gave me some assitance with the program Livetype, which we&amp;#39;ve had trouble with here at the CMC.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a great visit. Both relaxing and  productive. VISTA&amp;#39;s communicating and working together. I hope I get the chance to show them around the Community Media Center here sometime. I just emailed them my tutorial for Garageband and I will probably hear back from them with more info on Livetype and a program for ripping DVD&amp;#39;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich &lt;/p&gt;
