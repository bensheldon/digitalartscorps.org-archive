 <title>Question: How does your org. send email newsletters?</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/960</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m looking for a more professional way for my organization to send out emails. Currently when we send out mass emails, we send them from our individual addresses and put our members&#039; emails in the &#039;BCC&#039; (or even the &#039;To&#039;) field. Once I used an Outlook plugin called &quot;send personally,&quot; which sends individual emails to everyone in the &quot;To&quot; field. Ideally our organization emails would like to send emails our from something like &#039;announcements@our domain&#039;, we would have some way of managing where the replies go, and some way of managing two overlapping groups of contacts. So I&#039;m wondering: do your organizations use specific email newsletter tools? Are they web-based (like the ones in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idealware.org/articles/fgt_email_newsletter_tools.php&quot;&gt;Idealware&#039;s rundown&lt;/a&gt;) or locally installed software?&lt;/p&gt;
