 <description>&lt;p&gt;Nine months since &lt;a title=&quot; A bit of crossposting on digital storytelling&quot; href=&quot;http://ctcvista.org/node/1363&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I took the digital storytelling class at PCM&lt;/a&gt;, I have finally finished my digital story!&lt;br /&gt;
One of the on-call media ed instructors, Peta Mni came up with the last component of my piece: the title. Yes, it was that hard to come up with one.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Spring is Here!</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1265</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Is everyone enjoying the spring weather?  I know I am since I biked to work today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s been a good while since I wrote my last field report and so I wanted to keep you guys updated.  NTEN was awesome.  It was wonderful to meet all of the different people working in nonprofit tech and find out about the hot topics going on now.  It was also great meeting up with the VISTA contingent and seeing how everyone&#039;s doing.  Many thanks to Ben Sheldon for letting me stay on his extra bed when my hotel arrangements fell through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workwise, I haven&#039;t been up to anything too mind-blowing.   I have still been doing client intake along with a bit of Drupal fidgeting and am looking to start a little help/advice blog to assist clients in getting the most out of the services we offer (and giving them an idea of what exactly we are offering).  Aside from that, I was doing a bit of graphic design for a fundraiser that has picqued my interest in Adobe Photoshop.  I&#039;m a total newbie when it comes to Photoshop, so if guys know of any good guides to learn from then let me know.  Also, if you know of any good ways to learn JavaScript, then let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fingers crossed, I&#039;m planning on extending my VISTA term into the summer with part of my focus learning those two areas a little more in depth.  I&#039;m also excited to draw up a summer plan so that I can have more focus on a finished, capacity-building project as well as help the new VISTAs out with their projects.  So yeah, things are looking good.&lt;/p&gt;
