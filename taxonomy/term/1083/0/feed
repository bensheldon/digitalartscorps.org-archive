 <title>Wrapping it up</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1521</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Fellow VISTAs,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My term is coming to an end later (7/31) than most of yours so I still have some time left to wrap things up.  I&#039;ve basically just been working with our &quot;in-house&quot; evaluators on the data etc we&#039;ve collected to put together our report on TAP.  Although I&#039;m bummed about the program not continuing, I&#039;ve had a really great year and I&#039;ve learned a lot.  I&#039;ve been looking for other jobs, so far I&#039;ve only gotten one real response from the 10 or so resumes I&#039;ve sent out.  It&#039;s kind of nerve wracking but still exciting.  I&#039;ll be sure to post our final report and probably pass on the curriculum I worked on to Ben.  I&#039;ve enjoyed reading about everyone&#039;s experiences and will pass along more information/insights.   Good luck to everyone as your years wrap up.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Will&lt;/p&gt;
