 <description>&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to give you all a head&amp;#39;s up that it&amp;#39;s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ihop.com/tellafriend.php&quot;&gt;National Pancake Day Celebration&lt;/a&gt; at IHOP (I think IHOP is nation-wide, the name would denote &lt;em&gt;International&lt;/em&gt;.... =)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, everybody.  I just wanted to let you all know that I updated my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kirstenacademy.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Kirsten Academy&lt;/a&gt; blog.  I don&amp;#39;t know if any of you are interested, but for the December class, I managed to raise over $450 for charity, and my friends all got a lot of cool art.  Total expenses for me: $15 (a few snacks, and a SASE for an artist who said she probably wouldn&amp;#39;t get around to sending me any art unless I sent her one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Here&amp;#39;s what you do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Make a lot of friends/ acquaintances (if they are artists, that&amp;#39;s a plus, but it&amp;#39;s not necessary) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Tell them you are having an art auction for charity, and that if they want to come, they have to  make and donate some art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3)  If anybody protests on the grounds that they aren&amp;#39;t artists,  invite them over and help them make something (while making something yourself).  Also, let them know that crafts/clothes/food can count as art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Throw a party/auction!  BYOB!  Bringing snacks is encouraged!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the auction, I decided to go with a blind/silent format.  Everybody got their own bid sheets, that were numbered 1-50 (each number corresponded to a piece of art).  I also forced everybody to bid at least $1 on EVERYTHING, so that I wouldn&amp;#39;t be stuck with any unwanted art at the end of the day.  And I included a &amp;quot;Spending Limit&amp;quot; box on the bid sheets, so that people could bid high on lots of items without worrying about winning too much, and owing more than they could afford.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It ended up being a little more complicated to figure out the winning bids this way (it took a couple of hours to make sure that the art was fairly distributed), but it also meant that I was the only person who saw the bids.  So nobody got their feelings hurt.  And it also meant that there were no angry bidding wars.                      Cheap, Fun, and for a Good Cause.  What more could you ask for? &lt;/p&gt;
