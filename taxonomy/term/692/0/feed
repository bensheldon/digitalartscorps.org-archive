 <title>It&#039;s not enough to be good...</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/871</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Washington Post got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Bell&quot;&gt;world-famous violinist&lt;/a&gt; to play (unannounced) in a DC metro station to see what would happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/04/AR2007040401721.html&quot;&gt;What happened was this&lt;/a&gt;: of the 1097 people who passed by during the almost-hour of his performance, only a few stopped to listen for a moment. The violinist did receive $32.17 in tips, which isn&#039;t too bad, but still much less than one would expect for a Grammy- and Oscar-winning musician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, nonprofit organizations aren&#039;t the only ones that have trouble getting people to pay attention even if they are doing amazing work. Our work needs associated communication and the proper context, too.&lt;/p&gt;
