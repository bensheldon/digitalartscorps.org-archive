 <title>ANSWRing Social Media&#039;s Call</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1429</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;First off, Happy New Year!  2009!  Woot!  The calendar year here at Aspiration wound down sans Gunner.  Gunner was running around the world for about 6 weeks, leaving me and my coworker Mike to keep all the ducks in a row here in the Bay.  I thought it would be a bad situation but we ended up fine with our little buddy Skype helpin&#039; us out.  December was kind of a half-month just because I left for Christmas but I can confidently say that we got a lot of work done before shutting down for a couple of weeks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve started to amp up the work on a website called ANSWR, which will basically be a sort of one-stop resource for general information on nonprofit technology implementation.  For example, we&#039;ll have content aimed at nonprofits starting out (e.g. &quot;What&#039;s the best free email client for a mid-sized nonprofit?&quot;).  We&#039;re working with the people from Idealware and hopefully getting a lot of help from people in the sphere like Beth Kanter and Amy Sample Ward.  The cool thing is that Gunner is so incredibly well-connected.  It&#039;s ridiculous really.  Any time I find some awesome tech blog or hear about some nonprofit guru, he&#039;s like &quot;sammy?  yeah, he can throw down whiskey like water...&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m only now feeling up-to-speed on things in the nonprofit technology arena enough to talk about it on my own when people ask me things like &quot;What are your thoughts on Joomla vs. Drupal?&quot; or &quot;Why is it bad to use Google docs/apps exclusively for my organization?&quot;  It&#039;s a nice feeling to know that i can actually help people on my own now.  But at the same time, i feel kind of like 5 months behind.  I just think about what I could be doing now if I came into the job with the knowledge that i have now.  but on second thought, i guess that&#039;s the same for any job, for anyone, ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve also been trying to up our social media presence with me pulling official Social Source Commons Twitter duty (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/ssc_tweets&quot; title=&quot;www.twitter.com/ssc_tweets&quot;&gt;www.twitter.com/ssc_tweets&lt;/a&gt;) as well as branching out commenting in the blogosphere (Amy Sample Ward&#039;s blog is awesome and she might be the nicest person on earth).  I realize more and more about how just being a social media person for your organization can be a full time job.  There&#039;s so much to read, so many conversations to get involved in on Twitter, blogs, mailing lists...  I don&#039;t know how Beth Kanter does it...  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve decided to organize my work schedule as kind of a regular week routine with designated days and times of day to do certain things so we&#039;ll see how good I am at organizing work stuff instead of getting to stuff as it comes.  I&#039;ll let you know how it goes (because let&#039;s face it, you&#039;re all dying to know).  Anyway, don&#039;t cry for me Argentina.  The truth is i never left you.&lt;/p&gt;
