 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extending your service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You have the option of either reenrolling for a full year, or extending your service for an arbitrary length of time.  If you are interested, you should discuss these options with your supervisor and get their blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check on your Future Plans Form (available &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.americorps.org &quot;&gt;my.americorps&lt;/a&gt;) whether you are reenrolling or requesting an extension. You should also receive a positive performance evaluation in order for your extension or reenrollment to be approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing these options with your supervisor, please be aware that your organization will be responsible for paying an additional Project Fee and other financial obligations for hosting you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reenrolling for a Full Year:&lt;/strong&gt; By reenrolling, you are eligible to receive another Education Award at the completion of your second year (there is a lifetime maximum of 2 Education Awards).  Or, you can elect to receive the $1200 cash Stipend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extension of Arbitrary Length:&lt;/strong&gt; You can serve for any additional length of time (e.g. 3 months).  If you do this, you are only eligible to receive a prorated cash stipend (prorated at 1 Year = $1200).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End of Service Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Your will receive either the Cash Stipend or the Education Award based on the benefit you signed up for at the beginning of your service—or changed prior to the 10th month of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cash Stipend&lt;/strong&gt;: If elected, you will receive your $1200.00 of cash stipend as an additional paycheck that is mailed to you (it will not be direct deposited)—so make sure we have your updated address (update on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalartscorps.org&quot;&gt;digitalartscorps.org&lt;/a&gt;).  Please note that additional taxes are taken out of the stipend that are not normally applicable to your normal living allowance paychecks (e.g. FICA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Education Award&lt;/strong&gt;: All Education Award payments and management are processed through the official &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.americorps.org &quot;&gt;AmeriCorps website&lt;/a&gt;.  This may take up to a month to be updated following the end of your service. You can also call the Official AmeriCorps Support Unit: 1 (866) 473-5733. Your must use the Education Award within 7 years of receiving it—if you do a second year of AmeriCorps, the clock starts ticking after your first year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra Education Award Info&lt;/strong&gt;: Some schools will match the Education Award.  You can find a list of educational institutions that will match the award &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.americorps.org/for_individuals/benefits/ed_award_match.asp&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Education Award can be used for Educationally Related Expenses.  You can use your Education Award for more than just tuition.  Depending upon the college, you may be able to have that money deposited into a general account from which you can make educationally related expenses like textbooks, computers or iPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TIP: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globalservicecorps.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.globalservicecorps.org/&lt;/a&gt; - Use your AmeriCorps ed award to travel abroad. This organization made arrangements with SUNY Albany to allow participants to use their AmeriCorps education award to finance their GSC program fees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using your Education Award counts as taxable income.  If you can use the Education Award during the same calendar year as your VISTA service, your tax liability will be much less which means that the Education Award will be taxed at a lower rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loan Forbearance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you obtained loan forbearance from your loan institution and elected the Education Award at the beginning of your service, upon successful completion of your term of service the Corporation will pay for the interest that has accrued on your qualified student loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can access the interest accrual payment process by logging onto &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.americorps.gov&quot;&gt;my.americorps.gov&lt;/a&gt; and accessing your account.  From your member home page, access the link for My Education Award.  It will take you to the page where you can access the Interest Accrual Benefit Request.  Once you submit the request it is sent directly to the financial institution which will complete the payment request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if you have a Perkins Loan you may be able to get it reduced. More info &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalservice.gov/help/vistahandbook/chapter6.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (search for &#039;perkins&#039; to find the right paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefit Conversions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You have the option of converting some of your AmeriCorps benefits and continuing to receive them after your service has ended.  There may be (there probably are) less-expensive options than converting—but you have the option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Insurance Conversion (COBRA)&lt;/strong&gt;: Upon termination from service, you may convert from your group health care coverage plan provided by CNCS to a private plan administered by Celtic Life Insurance Company.  This conversion option is available to those who do not have other insurance options.  Your option to convert to private insurance must be exercised within 30 days of the date of your termination from service.  You may receive information about conversion by calling toll free 1-800-365-2365.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the Right to Convert form, that you will receive from Celtic Insurance, must be sent to &lt;a href=&quot;http://americorps.sevencorners.com/&quot;&gt;SevenCorners&lt;/a&gt; with the top portion of the form completed so that it can be completed by SevenCorners and be sent directly to Celtic Insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life Insurance Conversion&lt;/strong&gt;: If you chose to be covered under the life insurance policy during your VISTA term of service, you have the option to convert your Group Life insurance to an individual policy.  For more information, call the Official AmeriCorps Support Unit: 1 (866) 473-5733&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil Service Benefits and Eligibility:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Because you have satisfactorily completed one full year of service, you earn one year of noncompetitive eligibility for federal government positions (find one &lt;a href=&quot;www.usajobs.gov&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Non-competitive eligibility allows, but does not require, a federal agency to hire an AmeriCorps&lt;em&gt;VISTA alumnus/alumna who meets the minimum qualifications for the position, without going through all the formalities of the competitive process. The decision to hire an AmeriCorps&lt;/em&gt;VISTA alumnus/alumna under non-competitive eligibility is within the discretion of the hiring agency, consistent with the Office of Personnel Management regulations, which contain time limits for the use of this appointment authority.  In most cases, an AmeriCorps*VISTA member must be appointed within 12 months after the member’s VISTA service ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To establish your non-competitive status, you will need to request proof of eligibility from AmeriCorps*VISTA. This letter can be viewed and one &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.americorps.gov&quot;&gt;my,americorps.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interpreting Your VISTA Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You’ve just completed a year of National Servie through AmeriCorps*VISTA, a 40+ year old program (VISTA is, AmeriCorps is 15 years old).  How should you translate that into resumes, job interviews and other self-promotion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“AmeriCorps*VISTA is the Domestic Peace Corps”: most people know what the Peace Corps is, and think it’s pretty awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commitment to the Community: you demonstrated that you have a heart, and could commit to hard conditions.  Employers are afraid that a new employee, who they just invested a whole lot of training into, is going to up and quit.  This shows you won’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teamwork: you worked with other staff and as part of a national network.  Employers love teamwork.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High Degree of Responsibility: remind people that this wasn’t mere volunteering.  You managed a complicated project, setting goals, delegating tasks, developing resources and bringing it to completion. Talk that up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel Home and Reimbursements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VISTAs who originally relocated in order to serve a submit close-of-service paperwork, including a form that tells us about their travel plans.  Based on this info, the Corporation sends out vouchers for mileage funds and reimbursable costs, and make travel arrangements as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds allocated for close of service are the same as their original relocation costs, without the $550 allowance.  So, VISTAs who are finishing up get shipping allowances of $25/100 miles up to $500, and 48.5 cents per mile if they were approved to have use a personal vehicle as part of their service and brought their vehicle with them at the beginning of the year (i.e., no mileage reimbursement for anyone who may have bought a car during the service year). The Corporation also makes flight/Amtrak arrangements in accordance with the original method of travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VISTAs must return to the home of record the Corporation has on file (on your original AmeriCorps application) for them in order to be eligible for relocation funds – for example,  we can&#039;t send someone to their campus location if they are going on to grad school. However, if someone wants to go to another location, or  if they have decided to stay in their service location instead of returning home, they can request the cash equivalent of their airfare, which we would then add to their reimbursement voucher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Connected!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We’d like to stay in touch with you after your VISTA service.  Sometimes job postings come through or we have some benefits that we can extol upon you (e.g. robot squeeze-toys). At the very least, update your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalartscorps.org&quot;&gt;DASCorps Profile&lt;/a&gt; with your non-work email address.  We’ll try not to spam you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/digitalartscorps&quot;&gt;The DASCorps Facebook Page!&lt;/a&gt; - Connecting People: Facebook&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The DASCorps Survival Guide: How do you Search for a Job after AmeriCorps?</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1765</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowing Where You Want To Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here’s the unfortunate thing about Americorps, it’s not a career path. It’s a one year commitment that you can re-up for a few years, but that’s about it. So planning your path is extremely important throughout your VISTA year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the very rare case that you know exactly what career path you want to go down, your service year should be full with ample opportunities to go to conferences and make contacts with people and organizations doing the work you want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For The Rest of Us Without a Defined Career Path&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A lot of VISTAs have only a general idea of where they want to go beyond Americorps; so don’t feel anxious or guilty about not being 100% sure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many books and resources that give highly detailed ways of figuring out your dream career, and we encourage you to seek those out if necessary (see Further Resources at the end for some). However, here’s some quick and dirty ways to get at what you want to get in to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List all the skills you are good at and enjoy using the most (event planning, public speaking, writing code, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List all fields of knowledge that interest you the most (nonprofit management, public policy, digital media, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask everyone you know who you think might be relevant what they would define the job as. You’ll hopefully get a few people saying “Oh, that sounds like [insert dream job name you didn’t know of]”. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek out and talk to people who are in those jobs now. Ask them how they got there and for any advice they might have for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research and find those organizations that are doing that work &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contacts: The Best Way to Land a Job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For those searching for the next step, one good way to go about your year is to get engaged in as many networks, conferences, and functions as possible. The VAST majority of jobs in any sector are gained through personal or professional contacts.  The broader the net you cast out, the more contacts you’ll have. It’s pretty simple. Remember CONTACTS! CONTACTS! CONTACTS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many VISTAs have found jobs after Americorps with their organizations, other organizations they’ve worked with, or through other Americorps contacts. Think about it this way, it’s easier for an executive director to hire someone they know or someone recommended by a person they know and trust rather than going through an exhausting hiring process. It saves the E.D. a lot of work since they or someone they trust already approves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Your Federal Noncompetitive Eligibility Status&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After completing your full year of VISTA service, the government grants you “Noncompetitive Eligibility Status”. What this means is that you can apply for any federal job that you meet minimum qualifications for and get to forgo the formalities of the competitive process. Hiring government agents do have the choice, however, to decide whether or not to use the status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usajobs.gov&quot;&gt;http://www.usajobs.gov&lt;/a&gt; to search jobs and find agencies that will favor “Noncompetitive Eligibility Status” or just to see what kind of jobs the government offers. Typically you’ll have this status for only 12 months after your service ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build Your Work Portfolio From Day One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Following the old adage “show, don’t tell”, you should, from your first day on, be documenting the work that you do so you can demonstrate to potential employers how effective you really are. Documented work can be strategic plans, program outlines, curricula, media produced, code developed, projects managed, grants submitted, etc… You know you are a good worker. Make sure you have the evidence to back it up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Host Organization Should Be Supportive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Your organization and supervisor should be mindful throughout the year, but especially during the last few months of your service, that they need to support you as you transition and find your way to the next step. This means being flexible with hours when if you’re studying for an entrance test (GRE, GMAT, etc.), visiting potential schools for next year, job searching, or going out to interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your organization should be committed to and support your professional development. If there is a course that is related to your work you want to take or a book you need to get then you should free to ask your organization to support your endeavor financially of possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Framing Your Work with the Digital Arts Service Corps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Three Sectors:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. economy is divided into three separate sectors, private, public, and nonprofit. The private sector includes all for-profit companies from General Electric to the pizza place on the corner. The public sector is anything related to federal, state, or local government (Americorps falls into this sector). Lastly, the nonprofit, or third sector, is comprised of organizations founded to be in the public interest (all of the organizations the DASCorps serve at are nonprofits). It is important to note that while you have been working in the nonprofit sector, you have been paid and supported through the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicating Your DASCorps Work:&lt;/strong&gt; VISTAs work both for Americorps (public sector) and for their host organizations (nonprofit sector), so what’s the best way to explain this to potential employers? The best answer is: include it all! State that you were an “Americorps VISTA with the Digital Arts Service Corps working with [insert name of your host organization].”  You should also add that you “worked with a national network of technology related nonprofits and VISTAs through Americorps.” Trust us, all of that is very impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Resume:&lt;/strong&gt; Your resume is one part of the job hunting process, not the entire thing. Resumes usually serve the purpose of being able to cull large numbers of applicants down to a manageable few who then get interviews. It’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking your resume is the be-all, end-all of getting a job (online resume posting is very seductive yet highly ineffective), but it is really just a way to land an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your resume acts as a lengthier business card (no 3 page resumes!). You want to leave employers wanting to know more about you. Hence, you will hopefully get an invitation to an interview where you can explain and expand further on your skills, interests, aspirations, and experience on your resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know Your Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Coming out of your VISTA year, you will have TONS of skills and know-how. While it’s daunting to have to narrow down your skills to a resume-safe 3 or 4, it’s not actually that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of one big project or workplan goal you worked on during the year. Now, break that down to its constituent objectives and actionable steps (see the Project Management section for more detail). Each actionable step requires some skill that you had to employ. And each objective is made up of many steps so completing any objective takes a cluster of skills. This balloons on up to goals, which require many objectives, so completing a goal means you have amassed a number of skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But which skills do you put down on your resume? The answer is the ones you enjoy most, are the most effective at, and are the most complex. By most complex we mean the skills highest up on the goal/objective/actionable step hierarchy. Think of it this way, if you put a high-end skill such as “program management” down, it also implies a whole host of other skills like “planning classes, recruiting members, evaluating effectiveness, etc.” so you don’t have to explicitly state these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing your resume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are literally hundreds of resume writing resources available and you can spend days researching them all, but here is a quick DASCorps recipe for a resume:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define what job title you are looking for (i.e. consultant, administrator, programmer, volunteer coordinator, etc.) and research what skills, experience, and knowledge are needed to get that title. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a list of 3-4 of your strongest skills and/or knowledge that make you a solid candidate for that job title.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down successful instances where you’ve used those skills or knowledge in your past work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attach “action words” to each accomplishment that communicates results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List all previous work experience. Make sure you have no work gaps or can explain gaps (you can use volunteer work to explain gaps). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List all previous education or training you’ve had including college/university work, seminars, certifications, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List all community service experience you’ve had. REMEMBER VISTA is not community service. It is work experience. Use it that way!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing the proper format is also important. Most job types and titles have specific and commonly used formats (i.e. secondary education, social work, computer science). It is highly recommended to scour the internet looking for resume examples for the job type you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Interview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Employers will ask a lot of questions to poke and prod and figure out if you’re the person for the job. However, most interview questions boil down to these basic points of interest so make sure you can answer these in a variety of ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are you drawn to their organization? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you help their organization?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who are you (your past, present, and future)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What sets you apart from others applying for the position?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In turn, you should ask the following from employers if they do not touch upon it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What exactly is the job (activities, responsibilities, etc.)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of skills is the organization looking for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the general culture of the organization/what is it like to work there?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking these questions not only allows you to get the information you need but also demonstrates to the interviewer that you’re attentive to the organization’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as important as enjoying the work you’ll be doing is the environment in which you’ll do it. During the interview, be sure to ask yourself: Would I get along with the people who work there? And is this the kind of organizational culture I can thrive in? Keep in mind you’re interviewing them too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telling a Good Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
During your interview you will probably be asked to “talk about a time you had to manage a project, reach a deadline, work with difficult people, etc…” This is interviewer code for “tell me a story.” So, before you even walk into the interview think hard about a good cross section of “times you had to [insert situation here]” and prepare little stories for each one. Here’s one easy way to format your narratives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start with what you wanted to do, your goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say what the challenges and hurdles you faced were&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give step-by-step detail of what you did to reach that goal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describe what happened/outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describe how you were able to measure or quantify those outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emphasize your transferable skills (as you defined earlier) as much as possible in the narrative. Remember, employers typically ask about your past in order to determine your value to their organization in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some other general interview tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen as much as you talk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use your VISTA work to demonstrate your commitment and drive (i.e. the sacrifice of living at poverty level for you personal values/beliefs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not bad-mouth your VISTA host organization or complain about your supervisor. Be creative and say there were &#039;differences&#039; but you worked amicably towards your goals as a VISTA (see Conflict Course Navigation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring documentation of your work. If you have DVDs, manuals, research, websites, reports, marketing materials, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not make the focus of your interview your resume. That was the entry point for getting the interview. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer questions between half-a-minute and two minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&#039;t forget about signing up for another year!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You are only allowed to participate in AmeriCorps programs for 3 years, but that can include all forms of Americorps (VISTA, NCCC, VISTA Leader, PeaceCorps)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage your host organization to sign up for another year of DASCorps help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Want a change of scenery? Search for another DASCorps job throughout the country&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to try out a leadership position? Call up the Transmission Project and ask about extending your time with the DASCorps as a VISTA Leader. (You get paid $200 more a month!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 <title>Tips on getting a job post DASCorps</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1761</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to talk about your DASCorps experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thenewservice.org/2009/03/06/translatingyourexperience/&quot;&gt;Translating Your Experience&lt;/a&gt; - How to talk about your service in a job interview.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thenewservice.org/2009/04/01/careertipresume//&quot;&gt;Resume Tip&lt;/a&gt; - How to list service experiences on your resume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you serve in AmeriCorps*VISTA, your experience can help you get hired by the federal government. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you satisfactorily complete one full year of AmeriCorps*VISTA service, you earn non-competitive eligibility for federal government jobs. This means that a federal government hiring official may hire you without having to compete with the general public provided that you meet the minimum qualifications for the job. Non-Competitive eligibility does not mean that you are guaranteed a federal civil service job. You must locate an agency with a vacancy and interest that agency in hiring you. This benefit does not apply for other AmeriCorps programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To establish your non-competitive status, you&#039;ll need proof of eligibility. Once you&#039;ve completed service, contact the AmeriCorps&lt;em&gt;VISTA Certifying Officer giving your full name (including names you may have used during service), Social Security Number, and dates of service. A letter will then be sent to you. Duplicate the letter and submit copies with your federal job applications. Please contact: AmeriCorps&lt;/em&gt;VISTA Certifying Officer at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:alumni@americorps.org&quot;&gt;alumni@americorps.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To look for federal government jobs in your area: &lt;a href=&quot;http://jobsearch.usajobs.opm.gov/&quot;&gt;http://jobsearch.usajobs.opm.gov/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a VISTA Leader!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call up the Transmission Project and ask about extending your time with the DASCorps as a VISTA Leader. (You get paid $200 more a month!)&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://digitalartscorps.org/sites/digitalartscorps.org/files/vistayearGraphic6_0.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last 2 months of DASCorps service VISTAs start realizing that their end of service is near and they need to start preparing for their departure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some typical VISTA behaviors and attitudes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Negativity&lt;br /&gt;
- Dissatisfaction&lt;br /&gt;
- Hostility&lt;br /&gt;
- Purging&lt;br /&gt;
- Crisis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some general tips for VISTAs during this time:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Continue to think about and prepare for your future&lt;br /&gt;
- Build bridges - goodbye doesn&#039;t have to mean forever&lt;br /&gt;
- Give staff suggestions on how things could be done even better next year&lt;br /&gt;
- Prepare documentation of all your projects to leave with your host organization and to give to the Transmission Project&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The end of an Era</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1404</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well...it seems just like that my Vista life is over. My 2 years kinda flew by. I learned so much I can&#039;t even imagine where to start. Along with tons of software, I also had numerous chances to practice public speaking, attend business meetings on behalf of the company, and interact with all types of diverse &amp;amp; fascinating people. I suppose that&#039;s what I&#039;m most thankful for. Also, I&#039;ve becoming an expert on stretching my dollar-lol &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    A lot of my time here at The Media Aid Center has been consumed by building and updating our website mediaaidcenter.org It&#039;s a shame that I&#039;m just now getting a handle on the whole process, but it takes twice as long when you have high school students in the room who need attention. An important rule I&#039;ve learned this yr as far as programming &amp;amp; design is &quot;don&#039;t reinvent the wheel&quot; ! If there&#039;s a 3rd part app or excellent tutorial on a related subject matter, use it ! I mad the mistake of approaching things as if it had never been done before &amp;amp; I had to rely on myself.&lt;br /&gt;
     My time here has been pretty smooth. My boss is an excellent communicator and always kept a casual and encouraging atmosphere. If money was no issue, I&#039;d probably stay here longer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     I&#039;ll be using my two educational stipends to attend an audio school here in the LA/ Hollywood area early next year. I&#039;ll also have the time to better focus on my new hobby/website Fantastic Disaster Poetry at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fdp.me&quot; title=&quot;www.fdp.me&quot;&gt;www.fdp.me&lt;/a&gt; (shameless plug). I&#039;d like to thank everyone involved in making this program work. The conferences were great, I always got paid on time, and the leaders always showed passion for what they do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Oh and to new Vistas, never make a separate Vista email folder &amp;amp; filter to automatically sort emails. You&#039;ll forget to check it for months on in such as myself and not receive important training/conference info on time!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The time has come to say goodbye...</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1209</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! This is my last blog entry as a CTC VISTA. It has been a very fun and rewarding year for me.  It all started when I moved to California from Philly. I still can&#039;t believe I up and left Philly and all my family and friends to move to a place where I had no permanent place to live, everything was totally unfamiliar, and where everyone (except for 1 person) was a stranger. I remember feeling so scared yet excited at the same time. I didn&#039;t know what to expect. My transition was rough not only for me but for my cat that I dragged along (sorry Meechie). I was fortunate to be temporarily housed by my co-worker and his wife for a month and then again for a few more months after my first roommate situation went bad. But then I ended up with a really cool and compatible roommate in June and both Meechie and I have felt at home ever since. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where did the time go? It feels like I&#039;ve only been here a few months. I guess time really does fly when you&#039;re having fun. I still feel so new to the Bay Area and have many more things to do, places to see, and cool people to meet. I have accomplished a lot in the last year though. I worked really hard creating and enhancing curriculum for the computer classes that we provide, I taught digital storytelling workshops to the Oakland youth, created a databases, refurbished computers, installed computer labs in schools and other organizations, and helped develop the website. We distributed over 2000 computers and installed about 1500 to schools in the year I served. I&#039;ve gained so much knowledge and experience from doing these things and it amazes me how far I&#039;ve come in one year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now my year as a VISTA has come to an end today. But I had a fitting ending to my year. I participating in an MLK day of service at Sobrante Park Elementary School. My organization, along with Hands on Bay Area and Kaiser Permanente Hospital, installed 50 computers in the school. I had a blast and I scored a really cool MLK day of service shirt (gotta love free stuff). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So tomorrow I will be an official OTX-West employee. I will be doing much of the same and then some. I feel like I did everything I set out to do and I&#039;m really proud of myself for that.  I really made a difference in the lives of many Oakland residents, in that my service was a step forward in eliminating the digital divide. But it doesn&#039;t stop here. There is still so much to do and so much room to grow. I&#039;m looking forward to what 2008 will bring and hope that it&#039;s as good to me as 2007. Good luck to you all and keep up the great work! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace out,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naomi&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The end. </title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1076</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s been one year.   And all the should ofs and could ofs are now expired.   But I think I&#039;ve accomplished a lot of good things, learned a lot and definetely  had a great experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, I could have blogged more, or made more programs, written more grants, etc etc etc.  At least I can say that I have followed most of the workplan and hopefully instilled a foundation for a strong youth program at Media Bridges down the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the last blog, I have taught another great class - Ad Attack!  The kids were middle schoolers and very receptive to learning about advertising and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nmmlp.org&quot;&gt;NMMLP&lt;/a&gt;&#039;s list of persuasion tools.       They knew they were being marketed to, but only to the obvious level.  Hopefully they&#039;ll keep in mind the other marketing techniques and persuassion tools and practice being smart consumers.  For anyone teaching such a class, I would suggest recording some recent commercials from the kids stations and also places like BET and MTV.  I thought some of the commercials would be too mature for them, but these kids watch a lot a lot of tv.  One student really liked the &quot;bow chic a wow wow&quot; commercial - the Axe one.  So I also threw in info on sex appeal, since they already were aware of those commercials.  Also, when preparing for such a class, come up with a tv/media watching survey and throw in some questions also about what they think advertising is.  Then that will take you into a discussion about their favorite commercials and all that.  Anyways, that class ended with some short videos that were, eh, ok.  But I think the main point about ad techniques was well recieved.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of my month was rather boring, tying up loose ends, making an end of year binder and all that.  The highlight was going to Washington DC, courtesy of Danielle and that Housing Network conference.  I presented with Nettrice Gaskins about Digital Media.  I think it went well.  And it sure was fun to go to DC for free and hang out with the ol&#039; vista leader! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So thank you CTC VISTA project for exisiting and providing such a phenomenol opportunity.  This has been the ideal situation for me, being between schooling and not quite sure what to do.  I was actually able to utilize previous education, gain knew knowledge and experiences and of course look impressive on the resume (seriously).  Future plans (which is basically now) are to move to Oregon.  I&#039;m in Ohio, so it&#039;s a serious excursion.  I&#039;m going to the University of Oregon for masters in communication and society.  Maybe I&#039;ll continue down the path of media literacy, community media and media reform, as I have been doing the past year.  But who knows where this will take me!  And here&#039;s a note - if you are applying to school anytime following the VISTA year, whether you believe it or not, you are an impressive candidate for being in Americorps.  And depending on your duties and experiences at your site, you may be able to translate that into a full ride!  I&#039;ll be a graduate teaching fellow (fancy for ga) because I have Photoshop and Final Cut Pro experience, so I think I&#039;ll be teaching or assisting with those in some way (still don&#039;t know for sure).  So if you&#039;re going to school, try to find the department (even if it&#039;s not what you are going to school for) that can utilize your experiences, and hopefully you too will be offered an assistantship.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care all!  Rock out, don&#039;t crack out.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The final paperwork: things to remember before you checkout</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/exiting_life_after_VISTA</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Following is a list things to keep in mind as you exit your year of service:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change of address (log into digitalartscorps.org, update your profile)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Education award (see My.AmeriCorps.gov)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interested Accrual form (see My.AmeriCorps.gov)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;References from program director, site supervisor, fellow AmeriCorps members, team leaders, VISTA leaders, and/or other community members if you want/need them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addresses and other contact information for fellow VISTAs finishing with Digital Arts Service Corps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel Home and Reimbursements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VISTAs who originally relocated in order to serve a submit close-of-service paperwork, including a form that tells us about their travel plans.  Based on this info, the Corporation sends out vouchers for mileage funds and reimbursable costs, and make travel arrangements as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds allocated for close of service are the same as their original relocation costs, without the $550 allowance.  So, VISTAs who are finishing up get shipping allowances of $25/100 miles up to $500, and 48.5 cents per mile if they were approved to have use a personal vehicle as part of their service and brought their vehicle with them at the beginning of the year (i.e., no mileage reimbursement for anyone who may have bought a car during the service year). The Corporation also makes flight/Amtrak arrangements in accordance with the original method of travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VISTAs must return to the home of record the Corporation has on file (on your original AmeriCorps application) for them in order to be eligible for relocation funds – for example,  we can&#039;t send someone to their campus location if they are going on to grad school. However, if someone wants to go to another location, or  if they have decided to stay in their service location instead of returning home, they can request the cash equivalent of their airfare, which we would then add to their reimbursement voucher.&lt;/p&gt;
