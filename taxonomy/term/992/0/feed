 <title>Month 3: “Done Too Much” – The Job Eclipses the Project</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1373</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Month 3 (September 15-October 15) saw the growth of the IMC Production and Video News efforts that I began in the previous month.  Together with other volunteers I recruited, we covered five on-location events where we recorded interviews, filmed, and took notes to share with other community journalists.  We finished video previews/announcements about a local campaign to end truancy and a city Unity March that brought 150 people from different backgrounds together to support the local poor and to participate in county government.  We also attended a reception for artists and art-buyers, a beer and chili festival, and a panel discussion on the challenges faced by African-American male youth.  Our reputation grew as a voice of the people, and I used the opportunity to train another 15 volunteers on video editing, field audio recording, and radio broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Back at the IMC, I helped update the IMC web site by replacing old documents and language, and calling Web group meetings.   I really did not do much else on the web site, though, and real credit is due to VISTA leader Josh King, who fully upgraded the site to the latest version of Drupal and also redesigned it to be more striking, effective, and bug-free.  Trying to focus more on the a/v media projects at the IMC, I organized a group of Music Library volunteers to update the WRFU automation system, adding new PSAs, station IDs, and local music, and getting this database ready for publishing on our site.  I continue to work with WRFU to make sure that its members can consistently produce new content for the station, and Production room maintenance and improvements are a slow part of reaching that goal.  By the way, I’ll point VISTAs to ZaraRadio and SHOUTcast as good tools for community broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	For several weekends, I organized volunteers in the IMC Shows group to raise funds for the IMC by sponsoring some concerts during the Pygmalion Music Festival.   We packed up, set up, and tore down our PA about seven times in three or four different venues, but we got to assist and listen to some great music by local and non-local performers while getting out into the campus and raising some money for ourselves and area businesses.  We played loud rock music in the middle of a clothing store – and then in a vegan restaurant, which was incidentally voted the best venue in the festival.  We got to stand on stage in front of Dan Deacon when that very stage collapsed under the weight of his wild, raving audience and we worried that our speakers might not make it out alive.  We were exhausted by the end of those shows and I still haven’t received our check to give to the IMC for the time, labor, and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Looming in the background of all these activities was a growing body of direct service that I was doing back at the IMC.   During both September and October, I was responsible for calling meetings, taking notes, and facilitating the weekly operations of at least two IMC working groups – Shows and Production – and was often doing the same for other groups.  It was ultimately the Shows group that began requiring too much from me and relying too much upon me.  Since August I had been the only person administering the events/concerts calendar, responding to booking requests, reviewing contracts, and even running live sound and security at shows.  Earlier this month I realized that no one else was volunteering to do these things, and that I could no longer do so, either.  The more often people who came into the building associated me with the shows, the more they would come to me and write to me – instead of the group – for their requests, both big and small, while the other members of the group stopped showing up, or when they did show up, made such a mess of things technically and figuratively that I had to fix things or respond to angry “customers.”  It was annoying on one level and aggravating on another, especially because it prevented me from focusing on developing media training curriculum and building community teams.  As recently as one week ago, I found it harder to get project goals done at work than I did at home, because I was distracted by requests unrelated to my position, and I found it to be a very different and more negative interaction with the public than our video news outings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was merely the long summer-like weather that kept everyone active and busy through the end of September and beginning of October – so busy that I found myself taking on the tasks of other volunteers at the IMC, which seriously cut into my VISTA project work.  Overall, it was a good month if for no other reason than I learned a valuable lesson and communicated my frustration with my organization in a way that was well received and constructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	The problem stems from an admirable philosophical commitment to volunteering at the IMC.  There is hardly staff, decisions are made in consensus, and groups organize themselves around common goals and skills.  So, what happens when a non-profit with no staff suddenly gets “staff” members (two VISTAs)?  The new staff are asked to do everything from answer visitor requests in the office, to file leases and contracts and burn bulk copies of DVDs – because we’re there and no one else is, since everyone else is just a volunteer and shows up when they feel like doing so.  Nevermind that we are also volunteers, that we are not being paid employee wages, and that we have specific long-term projects that ought to take up a major portion of our time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	None of this is really the fault of the IMC, but has more to do with group dynamics and my offering up too many of my services.   Ultimately, I noticed this well enough in advance, and had the support of people like Josh and Nicole, to address the issues before they became too difficult to manage.  I imagine that other VISTAs have had similar experiences in their organizations; do not be afraid to politely but firmly tell people what your job is and what it is not, especially when they are unloading a lot of their tasks, hopes, and expectations onto you.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Month 2: Out in the community already (“Hi public, we’re the media… but you can trust us.”)</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1372</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I am submitting two reports at once this time.  The past two months were so busy that there was little time to reflect or to write about what was going on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the second month at my organization, I delved further into media training and started an active video news project with some volunteers.    Most of my work this month was interactive and in the community, so in contrast to my plans, I did not have much time to write training manuals.  A notable exception was authoring a revised Airshifter Handbook for WRFU 104.5-LP, our community radio station, with an extra manual on remote/live broadcast and streaming radio.  The last version of the handbook had been written two or three years ago, and lacked a discussion of the goals of the organization or a studio checklist for DJs new to the radio.  After talking with the Station Manager, we realized that a new handbook alone would not have much effect unless we also scheduled small group training sessions so we could discuss the social, legal, and technical aspects of running a community radio show.  Our efforts were successful and now WRFU has an established program for orienting new DJs and getting new shows on the air, while respecting the needs and goals of the IMC as a whole, which includes other groups beyond the radio station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those other groups is IMC Production, a volunteer group that I helped create in order to carry on and combine the legacies of the separate Video and Radio News groups that ceased to exist around two years ago.   Simply put, all the IMC groups make sure that some different aspect of independent media is alive, productive, and engaged with the local population.  Production is here to create audio-visual content for the community and for other groups, and to provide the facilities and personnel to make this possible.  While our work to improve the studio is slow, in only my second month as a VISTA, we were able to initiate IMC Video News.  IMC Video News actively searches for local or regional stories that are not being covered by other stations, goes out on-site to interview and shoot, and then edits and produces short-length film for distribution online and on Urbana Public Television.  Even though others in the IMC look to us for technical multimedia advice, we spend far more time interacting with the public than sitting in front of computer screens editing.  This has turned out to be very beneficial for our organization’s outreach and public relations, because we are listening to – and publishing – voices that others are ignoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, we produced segments on a Greenpeace Solar-Powered Concert (where I ran the mixer, too – next to a solar panel the size of a roof) and the closing of Illinois State Parks.  We also assisted with an Iraq Veterans Against the War forum on post-traumatic stress disorder (for UPTV) and re-published the local Books to Prisoners’ Our Volunteer Experience film online.  A sample of our work to date can be accessed on our new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/UrbanaChampaignIMC&quot;&gt;UC-IMC YouTube Channel&lt;/a&gt;.  To get this project going, we have been using Adobe Premiere, but we will be expanding to incorporate more open-source software for editing.  Two open-source/freeware video utilities that have been crucial to my work here have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://handbrake.fr&quot; /&gt;Handbrake&lt;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/mp4cam2avi&quot; /&gt;MP4CAM2AVI&lt;/a&gt;.  Of course, &lt;a href=&quot;http://audacity.sourceforge.net&quot; /&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt; is a robust, simple, and reliable solution for audio editing that I would recommend to anyone and which most people seem to know, anyway.  Though not technically free (you can use it for free with no features suspended or get a license for $50), I recommend Windows’ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reaper.fm&quot; /&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; for multi-track audio editing and sequencing because it is easy, allows for flexible routing, comes with high-quality processing built-in, and accepts most free or commercial VST and DirectX plugins.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t end there, though.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sunlightfoundation.com&quot; /&gt;Sunlight Foundation&lt;/a&gt; webinar that I scheduled between members of WRFU, Production, and Public i (the IMC’s independent newspaper) was a small event, but so useful that I am posting the links here for CTC VISTAs to view.  Bill Allison guided us through an overwhelming tour of websites that allow any citizen with Internet access to closely investigate the finances, bills, and records of members in the United States Congress, as well as information on lobbyists, federal contracts, and elections.  Obviously, these types of topics and data are of great interest to journalist and media organizations like mine in the IndyMedia network, but this set of links provides another set of tools that all community organizers can use to bridge the digital divide and help the groups they are working with attain greater access to knowledge and the political process in their states and in the nation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Congresspedia&quot;&gt;Congresspedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencongress.org&quot; /&gt;OpenCongress.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.govtrack.us&quot; /&gt;GovTrack.us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.senate.gov&quot; /&gt;Senate.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fec.gov&quot; /&gt;Federal Election Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://sunlightmediaservices.com&quot; /&gt;Sunlight Media Services&lt;/a&gt; - This deserves a special note for technology users/junkies: widgets with updated political and congressional data that you can embed in a web site or blog.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politicker.com&quot; /&gt;Politicker.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensecrets.org&quot; /&gt;OpenSecrets.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune535.sunlightprojects.org&quot; /&gt;Fortune535&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fedspending.org&quot; /&gt;FedSpending.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taxpayer.net&quot; /&gt;TaxPayer.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, when even progressive mainstream media does not address all the questions your community may be asking:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.democracynow.org&quot; /&gt;DemocracyNow.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pacifica.org&quot; /&gt;Pacifica.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	I hope some of you find these links useful in your own VISTA work.  Between radio, video, and live events, I trained around 30 individuals in the second month and identified many new resources that have helped me and others.  Meanwhile, I got inundated with direct service… but I’ll save that story for the month 3 report.&lt;/p&gt;
