 <title>Pre-Service Information: Shipping Expenses and Relocation Allowances</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/869</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From an email from Paul Hansen, May 29, 2007:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=== Shipping Expenses ===&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Corporation for National and Community Service (which administers AmeriCorps programs) will reimburse you for shipping boxes when you are relocating per the following formula which is taken from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://americorps.gov/pdf/FY03_VISTA_handbook.pdf&quot;&gt;AmeriCorps*VISTA Members&#039; Handbook [pdf]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The baggage allowance, based on direct mileage between two points, is $25.00 per 100 miles, rounded down to the nearest hundred, with a maximum of $500.00.  The weight of the shipment is not considered in determining the reimbursement.  In all cases, members must provide receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baggage allowance is paid by check from the Corporation and should reach the member within his/her first month on the project. For shipment related to close of service, the check should be received before or within a month following departure.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ship items before the orientation, bring your receipts with you and you can submit them at that time. Otherwise, you can fax them to us later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=== Relocation Allowance ===&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone relocating more than 50 miles will be receiving the $550 relocation allowance. This is included in your first living allowance check. The living allowance is paid every two weeks per the &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalartscorps.org/benefits&quot;&gt;DASCorps Payroll Schedule&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#039;t have to fill out any forms to receive the allowance. We calculate the distance based on the address that you provided in your AmeriCorps application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=== Relocation Information ===&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are relocating to a new part of the country, you should feel free to contact the people you interviewed with at the host organization for recommendations on housing. They understand that this is a big concern for new VISTAs and I&#039;m sure they will be as helpful as they possibly can.&lt;/p&gt;
