 <title>My first class at OTX-West</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/756</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I taught my first class last week and it went great! I usually just teach the Internet section of the class but this time I taught the whole thing. Our classes at &lt;a href=&quot;http://otxwest.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OTX-West&lt;/a&gt; are 3 hours long and we teach basic computer training, Internet, and the OpenOffice programs Writer (similar to Word) and Impress (similar to PowerPoint). It was fun and the students and parents enjoyed it as well. I received great evaluations from them on my performance so that&amp;#39;s cool.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also went to a 3 day digital storytelling workshop at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.storycenter.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Center for Digital Storytelling&lt;/a&gt; in Berkeley a few weeks back. I created my first digital story and it  was fun. I went with my coworker Domingo to get some pointers on how to do these classes. Jessica, the VISTA at CDS, invited us to attend. My story was good but I ran out of time and didn&amp;#39;t get to do everything that I wanted.  I am editing my story on my own since I have all the files and I am even going to try to create the same story using Flash (which is going to be challenging since still learning the software) and OpenOffice Impress. It was a great experience and I want to thank Jessica and the Center for Digital Storytelling for having us. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Later,&lt;/p&gt;
