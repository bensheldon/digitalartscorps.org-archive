 <title>Happy New Year and All That Jazz!  Jingle,Jingle,Jingle!</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy New year everyone. I hope everyone had a happy New Year. My new year is as busy as my end of the year events were. First let me say that the Pink House kids are great. The staff I&amp;#39;m working with are great. My supervisor is great and as busy as I am. We just recently got 20 Dell computers from a group who wanted to give our kids computers for Christmas.  This is the second group that has donated computers to our kids. A local group in our area also gave our kids some great christmas gifts. We are offering a webcasting class to the children and parents in our community. We also had a group donate some dictionaries to our kids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the community level, we are working on our goals to intergrate the community into the center and we have more traffic everyday. We had a neighborhood breakfast that was a smash hit for the seniors it was sponsored for as well as the younger set of residents who attended. We had the usual southern breakfast but we  also had great speakers and singing by the local youth choir and gulla poetry by a local poet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new service project will have a lot of techie things attached to it, webcasting, podcasting, possibly even radio broadcasting. We plan to make our own commercials and advertisements. Stay tune for the next phase. Fun, Fun Fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renae Out..........&lt;/p&gt;
