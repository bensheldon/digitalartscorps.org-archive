 <title>Muy Bien! Digital Storytelling @ IBA</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/629</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/171/421690115_852d4a487b_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Room Full of Storytellers (behind)&quot; title=&quot;Room Full of Storytellers (behind)&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;148&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;I just finished my first MassIMPACT Spreading the Stories three and 1/2 day digital storytelling train-the-trainer workshop, hosted graciously by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iba-etc.org&quot;&gt;Inquilinos Boricuas en Acci√≥n&lt;/a&gt; (IBA) and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iba-etc.org/programs/villa_tech.html&quot;&gt;El Batey Technology Center&lt;/a&gt; of the Villa Victoria housing development in the South End of Boston.  It was the first of two workshops I&amp;#39;m doing this spring in the South End, trying to foster some REALLY local working groups of digital storytelling facilitators.  I pitched the idea to David Kay of IBA and Giles Li of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcnc.net&quot;&gt;Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center&lt;/a&gt; (BCNC) after they both mentioned in separate meetings that they were interested in incorporating digital storytelling into their existing youth and adult programs.  As it turns out, they knew each other already and knew of some other interested community workers at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cstoboston.org/&quot;&gt;Castle Square Technology Center&lt;/a&gt;. I pulled in my fellow Mass Housing cohort, Seline, and a new friend Jayme from &lt;a href=&quot;http://lnshhq05w.hud.gov/NN/contacts.nsf/WebCentByState/2BEF8F8FFA44D794852566210067CD52?OpenDocument&quot;&gt;Mandela Residents Cooperative Association&lt;/a&gt; and our group was complete.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/152/421689958_53b7df9ad1_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;David, Seline, and Jayme Day 3&quot; title=&quot;David, Seline, and Jayme Day 3&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;We had a lively group of youth workers, adult education teachers, fundraisers, spoken word poets, administrators, and visual artists.  Every person had such a unique story, voice and approach that the finished set of stories ranged from a call for an end to the violence in the South End (and beyond), to a reflection on &amp;quot;kneading&amp;quot; your grandmother&amp;#39;s coconut cake or diversity in one apartment building, to the cold nature of Bostonians, and finally to an immigrant teacher&amp;#39;s love of &amp;quot;civic navigation.&amp;quot;  I heartfully enjoyed the subtle theme that emerged in many of the stories around turning challenges into blessings.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also brainstormed some ways that the three local South End programs can work with each other and share their existing knowledge bases and foster more collaboration among the organizations.  The youth workers were especially excited about bringing more meaningful use of technology into the youth&amp;#39;s experiences and helping them break down the barriers by street corners and blocks that are leading to fights and escalating violence.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/156/421689798_812a759314_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sheela helps Anna (Julio background)&quot; title=&quot;Sheela helps Anna (Julio background)&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt; was able to enlist the help of fellow facilitators Lisa and Sheela, which was more than necessary as we topped off the last day with TEN finished stories...well at least drafts! [They&amp;#39;ll be up on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.massimpact-ds.org/default.aspx&quot;&gt;MassIMPACT website gallery&lt;/a&gt; in the coming weeks, but here&amp;#39;s a few photos up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/ctcvistaqueen/tags/iba/&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; of the workshop itself.]  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next workshop is in &lt;strong&gt;early May (1st, 8th &amp;amp; 9th) at the BCNC&lt;/strong&gt; and I&amp;#39;m aiming to open it up to some local CTC VISTAs and others who are preparing for summer programs.  &lt;/p&gt;
