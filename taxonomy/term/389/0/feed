 <title>Making it...</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/311</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been wanting to say something about making it on low income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One, I don&amp;#39;t have any secret to doing so. But I aught to, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#39;m a bit different. A lot VISTA talk was about sacrificing by making such a low income for a year. I get the impression that for a lot of you, this is a big change. I, on the other hand, have hardly ever made more than I&amp;#39;m making now. And in fact, had been unemployed since June when I started my service in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever cracked $15,000 for a year. The amount I&amp;#39;ll be making from the living allowence is much more typical. And I&amp;#39;ve made less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I aught to have great advice. But I don&amp;#39;t I have horrible credit and I&amp;#39;ve been to a doctor once since my dad&amp;#39;s insurance stopped covering me when I was 19 (I&amp;#39;m 36 now). Hmm. I can say this, I don&amp;#39;t trust credit cards or checking accounts. Something always gets messed up. And don&amp;#39;t live off your student loans. That was a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the poverty level, but I still go out. I see movies. I hang out with friends, eat dinner (or lunch) out occaisionally. Take my ex-girlfriend&amp;#39;s kids to eat or to a movie. I&amp;#39;d date, but I don&amp;#39;t know how to tell what&amp;#39;s a date and what&amp;#39;s hanging out. I live like I always have, with bills hovering, a car that has problems, and lots of stress.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not easy, but with the health benefits (I&amp;#39;ve foresworn the Seven Corners for an MI Health Card) it&amp;#39;s actually an improvement. The fact that I&amp;#39;m doing something I enjoy for a change is amazing. And once this yeat is out I hope that my experience will translate into a job that I enjoy and gets me above the poverty level for a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope every one is doing well on their low incomes. I had a bit of freak out session with my car tire going flat twice and the door refusing to shut, but I&amp;#39;m doing okay now. I got a used tire for $25 and I just have to remember not to open my driver&amp;#39;s side door. :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Take Care,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich &lt;/p&gt;
