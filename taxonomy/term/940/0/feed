 <title>Learning from other projects</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1258</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was in DC over the weekend at a grantee meeting. The following is a reflection from my CCTV blog for those who are working on and thinking about citizen journalism projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, April 5th, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.j-lab.org&quot;&gt;J-Lab&lt;/a&gt; staff invited its 2007 New Voices grantees to Washington, DC to share program successes and challenges. Some of the grantees have learned valuable lessons so far -- insight that we can definitely use as we look ahead to the future of the NeighborMedia project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newcastlenow.org&quot;&gt;New Castle NOW&lt;/a&gt; in Chappaqua, NY, like NeighborMedia, is trying to fill a news and information void in the community. &quot;People do not know what&#039;s going on out there,&quot; says project editor Ann Marie Fallon. In a community driven by its public school system, the site strives to inform people so they won&#039;t be &quot;afraid to participate in the discussion.&quot; New Castle NOW, which runs on &lt;a href=&quot;http://expressionengine.com&quot;&gt;Expression Engine&lt;/a&gt;. features real voices because residents are not interested in &quot;pretend reporting,&quot; but does not currently allow its users to comment on posts. One challenge the project has faced is a digital divide issue: People above a certain age can&#039;t always figure out how to navigate around the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff South of &lt;a href=&quot;http://greaterfultonnews.org&quot;&gt;Greater Fulton News&lt;/a&gt; says his citizen journalism initiative, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wordpress.org&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; site covering an area of Richmond, Virginia, requires registration for top-level posts, but not to post a comment -- unlike NeighborMedia, which requires registration even for commenting. South&#039;s project is making strides into multimedia by having local students produce news packages; though he has offered training to residents on using flip video phones with built-in USB ports, it appeared that as with NeighborMedia, his bloggers have for the most part stuck to text and photo submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ourtahoe.org&quot;&gt;OurTahoe.org&lt;/a&gt; is another project that depends on student reporting to cover issues that surround Lake Tahoe, California. Students receive disposable cameras to take photos for the site. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ourtahoe.org&quot;&gt;OurTahoe.org&lt;/a&gt; was built in Drupal and had to be redesigned in Wordpress after Donica Messing received feedback that the Drupal platform was not very easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://accessf.org/guide/partners/newsdesk/index.php&quot;&gt;NewsDesk on AccessSF&lt;/a&gt; has been &quot;chockfull of challenges,&quot; according to project coordinator Carter Paige. The access center has been recruiting not individuals but non-profit organizations to participate in training sessions and produce media. But creating relationships with organizations who are willing to dedicate a representative from their staff to four hours of training (2 hours of instruction plus 2 hours of practicum) has proved difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
