 <title>CUWiN -- One Web Day</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/117</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CUWiN is participating in One Web Day (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onewebday.com&quot; title=&quot;http://www.onewebday.com&quot;&gt;http://www.onewebday.com&lt;/a&gt;), a celebration of the openness and freedom of the Internet and how it has become a major part of our lives.  On Friday, September 22, CUWiN will join other community network organizations around the world in celebration and education.  CUWiN will be hosting an open house were people can become familar us, what we do, and community wireless network.  We will also be designating part of our office space and allowing the use of our LAN for gaming (BYOG -- Bring Your Own Games).  The organizers of One Web Day are encouraging people to document their celebration by uploading photos from the day the Flickr, and tagging them with onewebday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not part of the day&amp;#39;s activities, CUWiN will be hosting its monthly &amp;quot;Hack Night&amp;quot; on Sunday.  This hack night&amp;#39;s focus will be a community wireless forum, and will serve as an oppurtunity to further educate the community on community wireless networks, as well as gain input from the community as to the direction they would like to see the project take. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
