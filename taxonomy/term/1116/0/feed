 <description>&lt;p&gt;Reviewed the current equipment at NESFP, and created a wishlist of new equipment that I feel would benefit the organization in their media expansion.  New Equipment: digital HD camcorder (Canon VIXIA HF S10), one External Hard Drive (G-Technology 1TB G-Raid3), an external Disk Burner (LaCie d2 Blu-ray Drive), blank disks and a spare battery for the camera.  The Blu-Ray burner is for archiving raw and edited video for their long-term storage.  The new camera and accessories have arrived!  I am getting familiar with our new toys.  The Canon camcorder is great. We had our annual open house farm tour this month.  Our first shoot was successful. I worked on creating a database of footage from Final Cut.  This is a pretty straight forward process.  In Final Cut Pro, you can export a batch list of any bin or bins with footage.  This file can then be imported into a spreadsheet.  The idea behind creating this database is to enable a user to search the existing video library for footage and interviews. Hard drive space management might be an issue as we shoot more (ie: running out of room for all footage).  In field with Don and Ben to videotape the assembly of a greenhouse.  Also went to video Swine School in N. Grafton.  This was an all-day event including lecture and demonstration with all things Swine.  Rough cut shot and edited of Equipment training.  Also edited a rough cut of photo promo.  Using Vimeo to host rough cuts, and eventually Youtube for promos.  Shooting schedule is busy through October.  and now..back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
