 <title>Frustrated</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&#039;ve been here for a couple months and right now I&#039;m working on volunteer coordination. I&#039;m trying to help community computer labs increase their productivity by helping them not only recruit volunteers but develop orientations and training to retain them. This all sounds very well and good, but so far we&#039;ve had a hard time getting coorporation from non-profits. Now don&#039;t get me wrong, there is a definite need here in Miami, non-profits are by no means working at their full capacity. They are for the most parts the same as non-profits everywhere else -- overwork and understaffed. But still, although we&#039;re offering them free services and guranteeing to do all of their legwork, these non-profits don&#039;t want to cooperate. I&#039;m left practically stalking them (and I know they&#039;re screening my calls at this point) to try to give them something I know they need. What am I doing wrong here? How can we develop an effective network of volunteers and agencies? I&#039;d love some suggestions here.&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks&lt;br /&gt;
~Vic&lt;/p&gt;
