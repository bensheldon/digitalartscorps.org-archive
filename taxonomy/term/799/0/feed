 <title>CSL update</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/984</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been learning about the system we have set up at the CSL and doing odd hardware/software related jobs. In the course of learning about the technology I  look to find resources to learn from, and have found good ones. I think it would be a good idea to set up a group or a forum so that we could more efficiently exchange ideas, which is especially important with regards to technical questions. There are free forum hosts that have a good interface, but I would like to see if we could set up a CTC Vista forum on CSL servers. Also, there is Google Groups, but I think a forum would be better. If there are any organisations that need computers , hardware, etc, there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techsoup.org/stock/rci/&quot; title=&quot;http://www.techsoup.org/stock/rci/&quot;&gt;http://www.techsoup.org/stock/rci/&lt;/a&gt; which provides hardware to non profits at ~20% market value. The conference/PSO was an excellent idea! It exposed people who normally wouldn&#039;t go to those  sort of things to a new and rewarding activity.&lt;/p&gt;
