 <title>NeighborMedia to the max</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: The following CTC*VISTA work product requires several hours per week of grueling 1-on-1 meetings with super-opinionated people, endless hours of preparation for grant reports, and a schedule that is nearly impossible to share with any other VISTA project. Do not try this at home...(or a host org without an incredibly supportive staff!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CCTV’s NeighborMedia project, your latest source of Cambridge news and information, has a mission: to foster the type of participatory atmosphere that’s been created by bloggers and YouTubers all around the world. That means our group of citizen journalists want to hear from &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; about the issues they’re exploring.  Click on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cctvcambridge.org/neighbormedia&quot;&gt;NeighborMedia&lt;/a&gt;  video channel at any time to read their stories, watch their videos, and find out how to get involved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the month of October, our citizen journalists generated a plethora of stories not covered in the mainstream media. Now, it&#039;s a brand new month, and that means new stories are being posted each and every week. Here are a couple of the best to give you a taste of what&#039;s to come:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In East Cambridge, our correspondents are investigating &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cctvcambridge.org/tags/mirant&quot;&gt;the role of the Mirant Corporation in the construction of a new boardwalk&lt;/a&gt; on the Broad Canal.  If you have a stake in this issue, attend the November 8th BZA meeting and let your voice be heard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Agassiz neighborhood,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cctvcambridge.org/tags/shady_hill_square&quot;&gt;the future of Shady Hill Square is in dispute&lt;/a&gt;. Give our North Cambridge correspondent your two cents! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The above is from a recent blog entry at cctvcambridge.org and is meant to be a tool to help us use digital media for community organizing. Please disregard the fact that the digital media itself is at a minimum, as we are still in the early phases of the project.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
