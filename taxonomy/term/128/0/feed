 <title>Entrepreneurship Conference for Youth in Illinois</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/357</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In May 2007, the Illinois Institute for Entrepreneurship Education (IIEE)  will host the 2007 Youth Entrepreneurship Conference.  Youth will be able to network with other youth entrepreneurs throughout the US, participate in business plan competitions, and attend breakout sessions geared towards business development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In March of 2006, I had an opportunity to take approximately 20 youth from WYTEC to the E-Place Entrepreneurship Conference in Milwaukee, WI. I believe their attending the conference  was beneficial to the development of our youth.  Youth were able to see how others are taking their talents to write a business plan, market their ideas, and promote a business that has the potential to bring in substantial profits.  One of our youth competed in a Speech Competition and was awarded start up funds for her business, &amp;quot;Baskets by Brittiney&amp;quot;.  Another youth was honored and announced best business at the competition by his peers. His business was &amp;quot;Songs from the Soul,&amp;quot; a neo-soul song writting business.  Our youth, as well as the many youth in attendance, had many unique and creative businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year our youth will attend the conference here in Illinois and we hope to accomplish great things in our home state.   We will have a youth who is in her last year in grade school present her photography business and another will showcase his song writting business.  We are also taking a group of entrepreneurs who united to for their own t-shirt corporation.  We plan on doing great things this in entrepreneurship this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in attending the 2007 Youth Entrerepreneurship Conference, you can register on the IlEE website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iiee.org/&quot;&gt;www.iiee.org&lt;/a&gt;.  It is time for our youth to learn that they can be great at being their own boss.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Youth Entrepreneurship </title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia &lt;/a&gt;defines &lt;strong&gt;entrepreneurship&lt;/strong&gt; as &amp;quot;the practice of starting new &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization&quot; title=&quot;Organization&quot;&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt;, particularly new &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business&quot; title=&quot;Business&quot;&gt;businesses&lt;/a&gt; generally in response to identified opportunities.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nfte.com/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship&lt;/a&gt; have the mission &amp;quot;to teach entrepreneurship to young people from low-income communities to enhance their economic productivity by improving their business, academic and life skills.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of CTC VISTA Project&amp;#39;s participants, &lt;a href=&quot;http://yes-inc.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; The Young Entrepreneurs Society&lt;/a&gt; (YES), has a mission of &amp;quot;North Quabbin/Franklin County youth unlocking their potential through entrepreneurship, job readiness, financial and technology education and action&amp;quot; and does so with programs such as a buisness center, cyber cafe, and social service marketing projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What other projects or ideas are floating around about entrepreneurship?  Here&amp;#39;s a place to start! &lt;/p&gt;
