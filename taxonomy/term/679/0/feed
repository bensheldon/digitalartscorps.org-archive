 <title>Getting in to it.</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I have finished 1/3rd of my year as a Vista. When I started I was very ambitious ready to sink my teeth into the community and my organization. I was on the brink of a new life and I did not know what to expect. I went to Boston and completed my PSO. I returned to Minneapolis and showed up to my organization on the next Monday. I could not guess what my first day was going to be, who I would meet. So I walk in and say hello to Michael the program supervisor here at PCTV and my mentor and partner. I was ready to pounce at any task he would give me. After I set down my bag and removed about six layers of clothing (This is Minneapolis in January, and I ride a bicycle every year all year; it&amp;#39;s not so bad it just takes some preparation and determination) we got started. What happened, what was the beginning of it all. This is what Michael said &amp;quot;Well we should probably get you some keys for the building and all&amp;quot;. That is what I had been waiting for, it was sort of a shock to me at first. Then is when I realized that Vista life wasn&amp;#39;t going to be a superhero action movie, it was going to be regular life, with a more positive and rewarding purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the first day passed, I got my keys, met the staff and the after school youth and got my desk in order. At this point I had no idea what was next. What was I suppose to do. The next few weeks were filled with learning Acronyms that I still don&amp;#39;t know the meanings of and trying to remember who is connected to which one. I had a meeting with the staff and we started talking about what it was that I was going to be doing at PCTV over the course of the year and when I should be doing it. I started researching, ideating and thinking a lot.  It&amp;#39;s been four months. I have planned out two new websites, started an after school graphic design workshop, and mostly just gotten adjusted to working in the non-profit world.&lt;/p&gt;
