 <title>Writing a Proposal</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/46</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://members.dca.net/areid/proposal.htm&quot;&gt;A PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR WRITING PROPOSALS&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any proposal offers a plan to fill a need, and your   reader will evaluate your plan according to how well   your written presentation answers questions about WHAT   you are proposing, HOW you plan to do it, WHEN you plan   to do it, and HOW MUCH it is going to cost. To do this   you must ascertain the level of knowledge that your audience   possesses and take the positions of all your readers   into account. You must also discern whether your readers   will be members of your technical community, of your   technical discourse community, or of both, and then use   the appropriate materials and language to appeal to both.   You might provide, for those outside of your specific   area of expertise, an executive summary written in non-technical   (easily accessible) language, or you might include a   glossary of terms that explains technical language used   in the body of the proposal, and/ or attach appendices   that explain technical information in generally understood   language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Proposals are informative and persuasive writing because  they attempt to educate the reader and to convince that   reader to do something. The goal of the writer is not   only to persuade the reader to do what is being requested,   but also to make the reader believe that the solution   is practical and appropriate. In persuasive proposal   writing, the case is built by the demonstration of logic   and reason in the approach taken in the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
