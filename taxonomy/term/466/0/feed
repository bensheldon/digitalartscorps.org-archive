 <title>IMPORTANT TAX INFO! Please read!</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/379</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;              ATTENTION All Current VISTAs and VISTA Alumni Who Served during the 2006 Tax Year!              &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Corporation for National and Community Service will send out the 2006 W2s and 1099s (education award users only) by the end of January.               To ensure we have your current mailing address, please be sure to log into the AmeriCorps Online Payment System at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.americorps.gov/for_individuals/online/index.asp&quot;&gt;http://www.americorps.gov/for_individuals/online/index.asp&lt;/a&gt; and update your permanent and current mailing addresses (&lt;strong&gt;THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS CTCVISTA.ORG - YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE YOUR ADDRESS IS UPDATED TO GET YOUR W2&lt;/strong&gt;).  You can use this system even if you selected the cash stipend option and not the AmeriCorps education award.              &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have not already created an account, you will need to complete a simple registration process by following the steps below:                      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Access the system through the AmeriCorps.gov website;                      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. In the login box, click “Help/Register”;                      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. On the next page, click the “Register to create a new Member/Alum account.”  On the registration page, enter your last name, date of birth, social security number and current e-mail address;                      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Click “Submit” and an e-mail will be sent to you which will include a link giving you access into the system.                      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Once there, you will be asked to create a Username and Password.                      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Click “Submit” and the system will bring up your personalized homepage.              Once you have registered and created a username and password, you will always be able to log in to the system from the front page of the AmeriCorps website.  Once logged in, you can update your mailing addresses as needed. &lt;/p&gt;
