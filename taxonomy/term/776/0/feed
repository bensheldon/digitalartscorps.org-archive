 <title>Big Job</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/959</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been here two full weeks now and my boss has been gone for a week and 1/2 of that. Plus, she&#039;s going on vacay next week, so I&#039;m kinda winging it. The good news about that is that I&#039;m getting the opportunity to settle into the job and people watch while getting comfortable. The bad news is that my boss and a few others are the only ones that know I&#039;m a VISTA. Everybody has been told, but apparently sharp memories are scarce around here. The sticky part is that the United Way has what they call a &quot;loaned executive&quot; program where companies extend their employees for a certain amount of time for a specific project here. People think I&#039;m one of those and there are some serious territorial issues surrounding that and the money that goes with it. I&#039;ve just stopped trying to correct people-they&#039;ll either get on board or get out of my way sooner or later I figure. I was told by one Senior VP of Resource Investment, in no uncertain terms, that I was not needed. When I asked what she thought I did, she admitted she didn&#039;t know-but she knew I wasn&#039;t needed. Funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&#039;ve got more of an uphill battle in a sharply divided workplace than I had originally thought. The really good news is that IBM and Sysco Inc. are funneling a lot of money into bringing the United Way&#039;s volunteering program online. It&#039;s self serving, they want a place to send their employees to volunteer so their community presence is increased--but hey, it gets me guaranteed volunteers! Right now, more than anything, I&#039;m conducting research to help formulate a plan of action to get us more involved with our external volunteers and outreach. I&#039;ve had positive feedback from my bosses and other more direct co-workers who actually understand what my position is. I&#039;m very encouraged about the future of the project and where it can go--which is a good thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week I will be conducting interviews in a psuedo-digital storytelling medium as the program Teaming 4 Technology gathers data for grant applications. T4T distributes computers to organizations that apply to us to help bridge the digital divide. I&#039;m going on the 10th to interview a center for the mentally handicapped and how they use their computers from us. I&#039;m really looking forward to that. I&#039;ll try and post pictures. These kids come and fill our vending machines, so I&#039;ve already met some of them and the staff and they&#039;re just fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have amassed a tremendous amount of research and data on volunteer management in a broad sense. I&#039;m going to try, when I get a chance, to post some of the better info and links on the Wiki, but until then-email me and I&#039;ll be glad to share if you need.&lt;/p&gt;
