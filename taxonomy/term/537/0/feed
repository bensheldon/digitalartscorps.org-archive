 <title>Audience?</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/540</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know anything about the program that is Audience? I&#039;m slowly trying to figure it out. Slow is the keyword in that sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, it&#039;s becoming the most painful experience of my whole entire life. It&#039;s also bringing back memories of when I tried to figure out Dreamweaver when I was fifteen and eventually gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked with a program similar to it in highschool two years ago when I voluteered at my local public access station. I only say it&#039;s similar because it produces the same outcome. The procedures are completely different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manual is pretty much a new appendage, going everywhere with me. Unintelligable bullets of playbacks, screens, zones, and magazines. It&#039;s not exactly a picture book either. Just bolded words and bullets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is one program I might have to spend a good amount of time with tutorials (which are nonexistent anywhere except for inside the program) and templates (which I&#039;m pretty much against using).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m 15% certain that after my birthday on Sunday, I&#039;ll have a newfound knowledge of this program magically because I&#039;ll be 20, and this program is probably a right of passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m 85% certain that all of Tuesday will be taken up with tutorials and photoshopping templates to fit my needs.&lt;/p&gt;
