 <title>Community Networking - Priority Area Home</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/resources/community_networking</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;greenblurb&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Networking&lt;/strong&gt; area includes infrastructure or service          projects, such as community ISPs or wireless community networks, and information          focused projects such as community portals (websites that connect people          with community resources and encourage civic participation). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community Network basics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; A community network can be anything 2 or more people who do something with technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technology is used in CN to gather and disburse content to meet local needs, a.k.a community knowledge networks. How is this better than more conventional methods (word of mouth, physical rallies)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CN has a physical infrastructure (providing internet access, email and web      servers, blogs/wiki&amp;#39;s) that enables an intellectual infrastructure with collaborative potential (need example here).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benefits to pooling collaborative capacity of community organizations using      technology, such as avoiding recreating the wheel, incorporating different      skill sets, and increasing empowerment overall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenges to collaboration in community networking, such as ignorance of      possibilities, information overload, or need for content to be too specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four levels of community networking: (1) create community portal webpage for community promotion, (2) create subsequent pages for local business and organizations, (3) build learning communities online, and (4) create effective collaborations, &amp;quot;communities of communities&amp;quot;, with emphasis on the quality of online summative information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community networks give citizens roles such as: infoscout, telementor, reference librarian, town crier, and discussion leader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multimedia as a ICT tool to give individuals and communities a visual web      presence or initial Cyber-identity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentoring/volunteering and Civic participation as an essential elements      of community networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impact of ecommerce on community networking and best practices for e-citizenship and e-community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What new technologies are being used for community networking (such as cell phones for learning or ICT Advocacy Resources)? What are the challenges of staying current with technological advances (budget, skillsets)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the skill/practices of CN that need to be taught to community members to have beneficial products? How do we articulate and publicize these benefits?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we connect existing CTC&amp;#39;s better with communities to effectively      share resources and best practices?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

 <title>Technology Assistance for Nonprofits - Priority Area Home</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/resources/technology_assistance</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;introblurb&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology Assistance to Non-profits&lt;/strong&gt;: projects which          develop tools or provide services which help small non-profits use technology          to build their capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CTC VISTAs working in area will consider challenges such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technology assistance models/approaches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Range of services provided by TA to NPs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference between TA for organizations vs. for individuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decision making process for CTCs to consider providing TA to nonprofit organizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steps to successfully provide technology assistance to a community technology      center, including assessing need, understanding impact on community, and management      challenges that affect tech integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to assess an organization&amp;#39;s stage of technology capacity: infrastructure,      integration, or innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technology benchmarks for organizational technological literacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you use the IT Service Capability Maturity Model to assess an TA      Provider&amp;#39;s place on the spectrum from ad-hoc services to continuous improvement?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approaching technology assistance in a holistic/transformative way (as a      coach) rather than just in a symptomatic/transactional way (like a doctor),      by tackling technology programs by addressing the health of the whole organization,      with a holistic focus on solving a problem but creating/building/supporting      excellence overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Digital Media - Priority Area Home</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/resources/digital_media</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;introblurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Media&quot;&gt;Digital Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focused projects include programs that  empower individuals and organizations to effectively communicate their values using media and advocate for their communities. These projects  engage both youth and adults in media making as means of providing technology training and media education.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CTC VISTAs who are focused on digital media projects are building the capacity of programs that strive to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Use new, inexpensive and good quality digital video, animations, and web tools to engage community members and groups &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Discuss media literacy topics, including copyright and fair use, censorship, and social activism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase computer literacy, including the necessity to stay current with constant developments in technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus programs based youth development research, including characteristics as age, social development, and life experiences, shooting for core youth needs and positive outcomes and ways to assess these levels and use this knowledge to shape curriculum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify instructional techniques to build upon the interests of each  participant to motivate/enrich projects and encourage use of digital media as a form of self-expression, such as project-based learning or digital storytelling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify techniques of quantitative and qualitative assessment and evaluation to benefit program development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Community Organizing - Priority Area Home</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/resources/community_organizing</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;introblurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_organizing&quot;&gt;Community Organizing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  activities involve bringing people together to act in common self-interest, in the pursuit of a common agenda, with populist goals that build upon the ideal of participatory democracy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few central questions for CTC VISTAs as we focus our work in community organizing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we define &amp;quot;community&amp;quot;? What are the power centers and interest groups?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does government work, in relation to organizing the community?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; How are civic values at the core of community organizing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the ongoing, central issues at a local and neighborhood level?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; How can the Internet be used as a resource to engage community members civically? What can we do as community activists online?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These resource portals are collaborative efforts to organize existing information and build new tools for VISTAs (and the organizations they serve). &lt;/p&gt;
