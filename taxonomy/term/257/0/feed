 <description>&lt;p&gt;The recent (2006) announcement that the Nobel Peace prize has been won by Dr. Muhammad Yunus has caught my attention.  Part of the prize is shared by a banking system called Grameen bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is supposedly working on the principles of community effort, mutual &lt;br /&gt;trust, accountability, and micro credit.  It is designed to offer small  &lt;br /&gt;loans to poor people in groups of 5, who are otherwise not credit worthy. &lt;br /&gt;The primary requirement for loan eligibility seems to be collective &lt;br /&gt;accountability of groups to repay. Because there is no requirement to back their loans &lt;br /&gt;with collateral,  the poor have been able to invest in some trade for their livelihood.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conditions for loan have helped improve social and economic awareness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system appears to have uplifted and improved the lives of many poor &lt;br /&gt;communities in Bangladesh, among whom a big percentage is said to be women. This indeed is a system of community, networking and collective effort that has not only made a success story but also has received a distinguished recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
