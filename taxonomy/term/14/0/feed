As it says on their blog, &quot;Critical Focus: A Forum on Media Today is a series of six one-hour videos investigating how representations in the media affect culture, politics, and behavior. Each episode features a diverse panel of experts from academia, journalism, the broadcast industry, and social action agencies assessing the impact of media on our society.&quot;  This episode focused on discussing some concrete ways citizens can learn about and change the media landscape.  Of course, I plugged both the CTC VISTA Project and MassIMPACT&#039;s work doing digital storytelling with housing developments in the Boston area.  I felt pretty privileged to sit next to &lt;a href=&quot;http://communitymedia.typepad.com/critical_focus/2007/03/possible_guests.html&quot;&gt;fellow panelists&lt;/a&gt; like Nettrice Gaskins, Lauren-Glenn Davitian, and Steve Provizer, who&#039;ve been working on community media, technology, and activism for YEARS, and have folks interested in what I had to add.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Intellectual Property and Community Media</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/digitalmedia/reformandpolicy</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an article written by Reebee Garofalo.  He&#039;s a professor who teaches about music and social movements at UMass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copyright: Its Still About the Content, Stupid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
By Reebee Garofalo&lt;br /&gt;
Original article can be found at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://acmboston.org/node/340&quot; title=&quot;http://acmboston.org/node/340&quot;&gt;http://acmboston.org/node/340&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reebee Garofalo is an internationally known scholar of popular music studies, professor at UMass/Boston, and founder of the Community Media and Technology Program at UMB&#039;s College of Public and Community Service, where he has taught since 1978.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last 30 or so years, I have been a popular music activist and educator. I have been asked to comment on the relevance of copyright law to community media. This fits with my own agenda for a couple of reasons: first, that music tends to get underrepresented in discussions of communication policy and media transformation (except when we want to censor it), and second, most of the copyright battles that will eventually plague all media have already happened in the music industry. We can learn a lot about the future by looking at the history of these struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Live D Web Conference - Neighborhood Networks 12/05</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/320</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you ready? I&amp;#39;m leading my first web conference presentation tomorrow afternoon to spread my digital storytelling love on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/mfh/nnw/nnwindex.cfm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Neighborhood Networks&lt;/a&gt; Quarterly Consortia Conference Call.  I met some of these folks back in June at the Digital Storytelling Bootcamp at the (HUD) Neighborhood Networks &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.massimpact.org/conference2006.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;RTAW&quot;&gt;Regional  Technical Assistance Workshops&lt;/a&gt;.  Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;/files/digstory_nn_120506_2.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;NN Conf Call Digital Storytelling ppt&quot;&gt;Powerpoint&lt;/a&gt; if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/mfh/nnw/nnwindex.cfm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://quest.nasa.gov/space/events/hud/hud-nn.gif&quot; alt=&quot;NN Logo&quot; title=&quot;NN Logo&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; width=&quot;364&quot; height=&quot;52&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I&amp;#39;m excited to try this new form of presenting and see if we can get more NN members excited about doing digital storytelling at their centers.  We&amp;#39;re using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webex.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;WebEx&quot;&gt;WebEx&lt;/a&gt; so I&amp;#39;ll let y&amp;#39;all know how it goes and if my efficacious humor conveys over web presentation software and teleconference call.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans are still in the works for more &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.massimpact.org/projects/digital_storytelling/index.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Digital Storytelling at MassIMPACT&quot;&gt;Spreading the Stories&lt;/a&gt; train-the-trainer workshops next year, hopefully out in western MA and something local in Boston, perhaps with Latino groups or youth.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My big project over the past couple weeks is managing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.storiesforchange.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Stories for Change&quot;&gt;StoriesForChange.net &lt;/a&gt;website development and looking for not only the right approach but also the best technology (and/or CMS) with a group of great volunteers and facilitators.  I&amp;#39;ve got a bunch of thoughts now about approaches to building social networking and/or file sharing sites with nonprofits, but I&amp;#39;ll blog about that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh did I mention we&amp;#39;re pulling together a MassIMPACT strategic planning and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.massimpact.org/members/board_of_directors/index.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;board&lt;/a&gt; meeting for next week?  MassIMPACT&amp;#39;s board hasn&amp;#39;t met in quite a while and the board members I&amp;#39;ve met with individually all have interesting ideas about where the organization should go in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>On Being a Community Servant</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/309</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:/donnette82@yahoo.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;donnette82@yahoo.com&quot;&gt;by Nichole Payne &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was having a conversation with an intellectual recently. He was debating whether or not he should take time off to do community service or go straight to graduate school.   He noted dispassionately, “In two hundred years, we’ll all be dead anyway.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His idea seems to be that we are in some kind of rat race to achieve our goals and make something of our lives.  This idea only makes sense, though, if those achievements will be completely permanent, and I don’t believe they can be.  Even if you produce a great work of literature that continues to be read hundreds of years from now, eventually the solar system will cool or the universe will wind down or collapse and all trace of your efforts will vanish.  And in any case, we can’t hope for even a fraction of this sort of immortality.  What my friend doesn’t understand is that change is personal, and if there is any point at all to what we do, we have to find it within our own lives. This is the reason I joined up, as did so many others, to serve as an AmeriCorps VISTA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a densely populated urban community beset with gang activity, disaffected leaders and failing schools.  I once heard a disgruntled teacher mutter, “There is no hope for people like them.” Even in the face of people like that teacher who believed our plight irrevocable, I fought for change.  I was the first in my family to go to college and pursue a life of education and middle class existence.  I never felt the burden or schizophrenia associated with straddling both these realities.  I always felt plugged in, privy to information neither side knew well enough to comment on.  Creating a program like Mind Over Media, at Technology For All in Houston, Texas, allowed me to capitalize on this position, with the chance to share my experiences with students who have similar backgrounds to mine.  I was able to share my experiences in a world outside the forced provinciality of the ghetto. I took students to campus tours, and they got an opportunity to speak with professors and college administrators about their dreams. It was amazing. Now Armando, a CEP student kicked out of numerous high schools for delinquency, wants to study abroad in Japan for computer engineering. I ‘m not taking credit for these students’ dreams, but I will take credit for the transformation of their dreams into tangible goals, maybe even attainable plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the true role of a community servant should be creating culturally relevant curricula, programs, and organizations. With the support and fellowship of CTC VISTAs and the guidance of VISTA Leaders and Project staff, I was able to make my work more than just relevant for others at Tech For All – I was proud to build my own self-efficacy. My friend’s true dilemma was that he had lost his sense of personal viability in his questions about service. The difference you try to make in life should be connected to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;; otherwise you run the risk of seeing your life embedded in too large a context.  Many human efforts, particularly those in the service of serious ambitions rather than comfort or survival, get some of their energy from a sense of importance. You have to be infused with the sense that what you’re doing is not just important to you, but important in some larger sense.  Sometimes it’s just knowing your efforts are important, period. If we have to give this up, it may threaten to take the wind out of our sails. If life is not real, life is not earnest. Then our only goal is the grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bio&quot;&gt;Nichole Payne was formerly a CTC VISTA at Technology for All in Houston, TX and developed a digital video / media literacy after school program for teens called Mind Over Media (check out the video).  Nichole is currently a PhD student in the Anthropology program at Rice University.&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Lessons Learned: Summer Youth Tech Program at C4K</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/digest/fall06/blog_raymond</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;[From the blog of &lt;a href=&quot;/user/836&quot;&gt;Raymond Varona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/blog/raymond_varona/archives/001447.html#comments&quot;&gt;August 23, 2006&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;float_right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/profile-images/picture-836.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CTC VISTA Ray Varona&quot; title=&quot;CTC VISTA Ray Varona&quot; hspace=&quot;10&quot; vspace=&quot;10&quot; width=&quot;85&quot; height=&quot;71&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Raymond Varona&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the summer, most of our population was made up of kids whose primary language wasn&amp;#39;t English and who had never used a computer before. As a result, the workshops were more like guided activities instead of real skill-building sessions since I have to literally show them, step-by-step, how to do every action (including opening files and browsing through folders). So I started off with an intro to Photoshop and gradually worked my content down to the point where my last workshop was on how to change fonts in different programs...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings up a significant problem for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.computers4kids.net/&quot;&gt;Computers 4 Kids&lt;/a&gt; in that we have some kids that are learning how to program and others that are learning how to use a mouse, and somehow our programs and curricula have to include both. Definitely something I&amp;#39;ll continue to address as the year presses on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participatory culture is about the intersection of digital media tools and the ongoing transition of the World Wide Web from a collection of websites to a full-fledged computing platform serving a variety of web-based applications to people. I use the term “participatory culture” to reference the concept of active participation or the act of sharing in the creation of ideas, versus the “passive” scenario where people can receive information but are not allowed to engage in the creation or selection.  Participation also refers to the availability of sources and individuals’ ability to customize their media experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are at the beginning stages of a shift that will allow people, not only to create and distribute content and ideas, but also to act as filters and editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve been writing about the major trends emerging in new media and technology tools that significantly reflect changing attitudes toward technology and communication.  I contend that these trends have a considerable impact on society, especially young people growing up in the sensory-inundated environment of digital technology and mass media in the 21st century.  These trends include open source applications, online video/audio, participatory media or personal broadcasting, and dynamic knowledge creation and social networking tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to focus here on dynamic knowledge creation and online social networking tools. When effectively integrated into programs, these tools can extend learning in powerful ways. They can provide students with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to up-to-date, primary source material;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ways to collaborate with peers, teachers, and experts around the world;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunities to express understanding via images, video, sound, and text;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunities to learn coding (html and CSS) and use tools to create and edit online content &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a real connection between teaching students web design, online distance learning (ex. &lt;a href=&quot;http://moodle.org/&quot;&gt;Moodle&lt;/a&gt;), and popular services such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myspace.com&quot;&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; (I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myspace.com/nettiebeatrice&quot;&gt;my own page&lt;/a&gt;) and&lt;a href=&quot;http://secondlife.com/&quot;&gt; Second Life,&lt;/a&gt;. Second Life is a cross between a social network and gaming platform (even though it’s not a game) or computer-controlled virtual universe where virtual people interact with each other to do anything they can think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that popular culture not only reflects what people are consuming and using but also can provide clues on how to develop new and exciting projects for young people today and in the near future. I think that MySpace and Second Life are more than just distractions. As an educator, I am thinking of ways to use these applications to develop building blocks for learning web design and development, including online course development/management. It is important to note, however, that almost any application can be dangerous if used incorrectly or without the proper understanding of the rules and guidelines (or terms and conditions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning how to code for the Web is becoming an essential skill, and editing MySpace requires knowledge of coding and web publishing.  Why not use MySpace as a tool to teach these and other web skills?  I enjoy creating images for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myspace.com/nettiebeatrice&quot;&gt;my page&lt;/a&gt;, but MySpace has been educational for me as well, as it helped me to learn CSS (I am much better with HTML).  In my opinion learning CSS is the first step to advanced web design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring MySpace and other tools, like Second Life, on my own has been very helpful in my work as an educator.  Second Life uses Linden Scripting Language (LSL) that is similar to Macromedia Flash Actionscript so I&amp;#39;ve been able to teach basic Actionscript to students as young as 12.  Second Life is also being used to extend the traditional classroom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Second Life provides a unique and flexible environment for educators interested in distance learning, computer supported cooperative work, simulation, new media studies, and corporate training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second Life provides an opportunity to use simulation in a safe environment to enhance experiential learning, allowing individuals to practice skills, try new ideas, and learn from their mistakes. The ability to prepare for similar real-world experiences by using Second Life as a simulation has unlimited potential!” - &lt;a href=&quot;http://secondlife.com/community/education.php&quot;&gt;http://secondlife.com/community/education.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to successfully integrating these tools and technologies into education is to have an explicit purpose and shared objective for everyone involved.  Assignments should be project-based and encourage collaboration between students and teachers, who both need to feel comfortable creating, editing, and publishing with the tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participatory culture shifts the focus of digital media creation from one of individual expression to community involvement and civic participation.  The new ‘core competencies’ almost all involve collaboration and online social networking.  The role of non-profit organizations, especially community technology and media centers, is to help their members gain skills that build on the foundation of digital literacy, such as research and technical skills and critical thinking in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Digital Distribution</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/133</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So far, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_distribution&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Digital Distribution entry on Wikipedia&quot;&gt;digital distribution&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(or digital delivery) discussions among CTC VISTAs have been focused on video sharing, mostly among cable access stations (such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youthchannel.org/NYMAP.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NYMAP &lt;/a&gt;or &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalbicycle.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Digital Bicycle &lt;/a&gt;projects).  With the explosion of video sharing sites such as YouTube, Google Video, and Blip.tv, the ability to share video content has become almost second-hand to young web users.  Factor in the ease of peer-to-peer network technology and we have an environment where youth could certainly be sharing all sorts of their own digital content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inherent in this area too are stumbling blocks such as copyright (see Creative Commons), &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Rights_Management&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;DRM&quot;&gt;digital rights management,&lt;/a&gt;  and loss of video quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can CTC VISTAs tap into these trends and resources to support their efforts?&lt;/strong&gt;  Blog your ideas, lessons learned, and questions and tag it &amp;quot;digital distribution.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s some other topics identified at the PSO around this area:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-outreach to local community organizations to share content&lt;br /&gt;-Podcasting&lt;br /&gt;-Videoblogging&lt;br /&gt;-issues around distribution of youth content &lt;/p&gt;
