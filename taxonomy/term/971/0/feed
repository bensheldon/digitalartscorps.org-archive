 <title>&quot;Freedom of Speech is Having a TV Show&quot;</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1675</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you are all doing well and may the warmer weather be treating you kindly and hopefully not causing your body to react to unfortunate world of allergens or even to the adjustment to the change in weather. My allergies are sucking bad right now, especially considering I do not even know what is causing this discomfort out here in the South West! GO NETI POT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, my service here with Quote...Unquote, Inc could not be going better. I am re-signing my VISTA membership with QUQ, YAY! I really feel confident in the work I am executing and I have a great staff support system, which is always reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also attached a nice outline/spreadsheet that our fundraiser committee developed. Please check it out &amp;amp; provide feedback. This outline is proving itself effective as it is easier to organize which development ideas are more feasible than others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of some things I have been working on and developing (Every 2 weeks I send my boss a bi-weekly report of the things I have been doing, so it is easier to copy &amp;amp; paste that report into the field report):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Researched an effective and efficient underwriting/membership tier system to assist with the fundraising committee to develop a membership package. This model will be used by Amelia Salas, who is QUQ&#039;s Underwriting/Sales staff person. When she meets with prospective sponsors this will help with the sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Compiled content from other staff for the creation of our monthly e-newsletter and sent it out to all subscribers (I have also created a &quot;How To create an e-newsletter&quot; that will be used as a guideline for it to become eventually sustainable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Mike Trujillo and I developed a contract/template to send to the NM Film Office which will help to clarify the terms in which QUQ receives programming for Encantada TV and ways to cross-promote each organization&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Had a meeting with Regina Chavez, Creative Albuquerque, discussing ways we can partner with eachother (cross-promotion)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Had a phone meeting with Maresa Thompson from the Albuq. Convention &amp;amp; Visitors Bureau office about them submitting programming and QUQ receiving a trade membership that would allow QUQ to get listed on their website and to send out an article in their monthly e-newsletter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Meetings about the Prometheus community radio tour--helping to develop the schedule for when they visit and how their presentations will pertain to QUQ and youth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Fundraiser Meeting (every Tuesday) to update eachother about grant opportunities and to develop a strategies to execute some of these funding models&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Met with members of Enlace Comunartio and Citizen School to discuss ways QUQ can help them with creating a youth-focused PSA about healthy vs unhealthy relationships (focusing on domestic violence within teenage relationships)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Had a productive phone meeting with Anne from Miro Community to discuss how QUQ is utilizing our Community Media Space to the best of our ability with highlighting local offices (ACVB) and giving Anne feedback on the site, advice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Met with members from the NM Latin Dance Festival. John Ortiz &amp;amp; I discussed how we can help cross-promote each other. The exchange is that QUQ will work on media/videos for them and in exchange they give us advertising space&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Steve and I went to the NM Community Foundation website to create an organizational profile that as certain funding comes in through their office, when they do a search they match up projects with available funding. They basically have a searchable database that they use, they do not have an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-At the fundraising meeting, we delegated different grants to the members to research &amp;amp; report back their feasibility and application to QUQ (i.e. is it worth our time to fill out the application). I will include this in my &quot;How to Outreach &amp;amp; Fundraise Guide.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Also, Steve, Amelia and I finalized a draft for the &quot;QUQ Annual Membership Package&quot; which breaks down the membership into tier levels (different incentives for each category, more incentives for the &quot;higher category&quot;). This will hopefully be an incentive for producers to want to enhance their membership and purchase the higher of the categories. I will include this in my &quot;How to Outreach &amp;amp; Fundraiser Guide.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Attended the in-service training/staff development for the Prometheus workshop (learning about different communication models and how to effectively construct a message to convey to a particular audience)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Attended the main Prometheus event at MACCS which presented more of a media literacy 101 and how to better understand your community and their issues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Sent out outreach email through a media industry listserv requesting filmmakers to submit their programs to Encantada TV, I have received a few emails indicating their willingness to submit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Worked on compiling content/articles for the newsletter (which Steve and I decided to only send out once a month)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-I was brainstorming ways to better promote our community media space and I came up with sending out a monthly e-bulletin titles &quot;Community Video Showcase.&quot; This will highlight a video from our CMS and send it to everyone on our newsletter mailing list. This had a high &quot;open&quot; rate from our subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Had a follow up meeting with Maresa Thompson, from Albuq Visitors &amp;amp; Convention Bureau about finalizing our contract/trade agreement. QUQ will supply broll footage to ACVB and event/video coverage of the arts &amp;amp; culture festival &quot;Savor&quot; in June, in exchange we get a ACVB (valued at $400) membership&lt;/p&gt;
