 <title>Radio Nerds 2009</title>
 <link>http://digitalartscorps.org/node/1490</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From March 31-April 4 I attended the NFCB (National Federation for Community Broadcasters) annual conference in Portland, OR. What struck me immediately when I arrived at the Hilton was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. I was one of the youngest, if not the youngest, person at this conference&lt;br /&gt;
2. The radio station I represent was the most illegitimate, pirate, DIY station out of any other station being represented&lt;br /&gt;
3. I thought I was nerdy but I barely was at all compared to these people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the different sessions were separated into the following tracks: All, Producers, Development/Underwriting, Fundraising, Management, Youth, Community Engagement, Technology. Naturally, I chose sessions under the producers and development tracks for the most part because that is what I focus on developing in my work at ZUMIX Radio. I dabbled in a bit of everything to get a comprehensive learning experience at this conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are the sessions I attended: Interview Techniques, Strategic Planning, Marketing, Setting Up a Membership Program, Producers Shaping the Sound of Tomorrow, How Do I get more Latinos to Listen to My Station?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, I found the conference to be an excellent learning experience. I was disappointed by a few of the sessions that I was counting on to be helpful, namely the marketing and getting more Latinos to listen sessions. I couldn&#039;t have expected every session to be amazing! I wished there was a session specifically geared towards getting underwriting going for a community station. Underwriting is something I have been working towards achieving for ZUMIX Radio since I began my year of service but sadly hasn&#039;t gotten much of anywhere. Bummer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a field trip for conference attendees to KBOO which is a community radio station in Portland. I enjoyed this part of the conference immensely because KBOO is full of some of the most eccentric people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting, including this dude with this insanely tricked out bike:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://s17.photobucket.com/albums/b75/scottxkillyouxxx/?action=view&amp;amp;current=P1010040.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b75/scottxkillyouxxx/P1010040.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Photobucket&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://s17.photobucket.com/albums/b75/scottxkillyouxxx/?action=view&amp;amp;current=P1010037.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b75/scottxkillyouxxx/P1010037.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Photobucket&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://s17.photobucket.com/albums/b75/scottxkillyouxxx/?action=view&amp;amp;current=P1010036.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b75/scottxkillyouxxx/P1010036.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Photobucket&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a snippet of the inside of KBOO:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://s17.photobucket.com/albums/b75/scottxkillyouxxx/?action=view&amp;amp;current=P1010039.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b75/scottxkillyouxxx/P1010039.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Photobucket&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My jealousy festers over their insane music library, and its color-coded organization!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://s17.photobucket.com/albums/b75/scottxkillyouxxx/?action=view&amp;amp;current=P1010038.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b75/scottxkillyouxxx/P1010038.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Photobucket&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was invited to participate in a late night show after schmoozing with some staff people there! Sadly, none of the contacts I made followed up with any of my e-mails, the same goes for the people I met at the actual conference. Shrug. People are busy I suppose. All in all it was a great experience and a pretty cool city. I think I brought back some useful knowledge to ZUMIX and I would recommend this conference to anyone working for a community radio station. I would like to attend next year!&lt;/p&gt;
