 <title>Decisions, decisions...</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anyone else starting to think about what you’re going to do after done with your CTC VISTA term of service?&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;(I’m only about 5 ½ months in…) I’ve been trying to figure it out since day one practically.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Don’t get me wrong; it’s not because I hate what I’m doing and am counting the days until I’m done.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Far from it, in fact!&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I love what I’m doing, I love the people I’m working with, I love where I work, the list goes on!&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Part of the reason why I chose to be a member of the AmeriCorps VISTA program for a second year is because I didn’t know what I wanted to do after completing my first year.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Sure, I had a much better idea, but the options were so numerous, and I didn’t feel ready to decide what I wanted to do with the rest of my life career-wise.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So I decided to take another year to try to make up my mind (among other things), but wanted to continue to make a difference while learning something new.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;(My first year as a VISTA member was spent managing volunteers, planning events, creating publications, and doing research for the homeless coalition in Indianapolis…COMPLETELY different from what I’m doing now so I can’t even compare the two.)&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Learn new things I have.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I honestly never imagined that I would have any sort of technical position because I didn’t have the background (I graduated with a degree in audiology and speech-language pathology), but here I am testing software and providing technical support, to name a couple things.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;And I’m finding out it’s not so bad.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;And a few HTML, Dreamweaver, and Photoshop classes later, I’m finding out it’s really pretty neat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So where does that leave me?&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;(This is my fourth time starting this paragraph.)&lt;span&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;Although I’m at no professional level or expert, it seems like I have &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; options.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If I recall correctly, I think it was Jimmy Buffett who said “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Indecision may or may not be my problem.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
