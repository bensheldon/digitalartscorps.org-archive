				<p>March was crazy.  LTSC had applied as a partner with a bunch of other California organizations for funding on the first round of BTOP, a federal grant for developing broadband access.  First, we found out that we didn't get the first round grant; then, we learned we were being dropped from the partnership.  So, we decided to apply on our own for the next round, which meant the beginning of March was pretty much non-stop grant writing and cranking out a 50-page application in about a week and a half.  We probably won't get this second round, but it was worth a try.</p>
<p>Now that the application has been submitted, I've gone back to the networking and training of residents.  I've recruited a few residents to become "Network Representatives."  Starting next week, they'll be learning about the free internet at their building, how to fix it, etc.  They'll also be learning how to teach their fellow residents how to log on, how to troubleshoot, etc.  Hoping to recruit more volunteers so every building has two representatives.</p>
<p>Have also been trying to stabilize the free wifi at this building.  So far, it has involved frankensteining some equipment, some soldering, and a lot of dragging ethernet cable through bird shit.  :)</p>
<p>Hope everyone is doing well as we approach the final few months...</p>

				<p>Greetings from the warm South West folks!</p>
<p>I apologize for not posting sooner, but gosh, time does fly by, eh?</p>
<p>With the 6-month marker recently passing for all of us being in our first year, serving as an Americorps DASCORPS VISTA, let's give it up for all of us---woot woot! Congrats ;)</p>
<p>I would say a refreshing and assuring incident recently was our 6-month eval report. During that meeting with my supervisor and filling out the online evaluation (thank you surveymonkey, love that service!), it helped to give me a bit of perspective and reassurance of how I was doing as a VISTA. Sometimes, there are moments where I feel uncertain or just in a weird funk where I think to myself, "Am I doing all I can for this organization and my commitment?" This brief moment of uncertainty is natural, and almost comforting as well, because I am confident in saying I have been doing a great job. My performance is credited to the great support system provided by the Quote...Unquote, Inc staff. After these brief moments of self-reflection, I think about all the great partnerships, community building efforts, and the assistance with fundraiser efforts that makes me feel good about my role here...</p>
<p>I will list out a few of the things I have further enhanced or developed over the last couple of months:</p>
<p>* Worked on QUQ goals for the Prometheus Community Radio Tour<br />
* Steve and I met with members from Enlace Comunartio, NPO that provides resources for immigrants and battered women, about ways to partner together--work with their youth program and film some of their community events<br />
* Compiled logos for the partner orgs we work with for Colleen to upload to our "partnership" section of the website<br />
* Met with Gwen and Amelia to discuss initial strategies for fundraising....Researched and compiled information on Small Business Association--this would potentially allow QUQ apply for contracts and non-competitive federal funding<br />
* Organized all necessary information for QUQ to host a table/booth at the upcoming Digital Arts Conference held at UNM Continuing Education<br />
* Organized all necessary information/articles/graphics for the e-newsletter to be sent out<br />
* Worked on outlining and creating an instructional guide for others to follow for the construction of the e-newsletter (sustainability)<br />
* Facilitated Enlace members and Vagina Monologues performers to be guests on Allen Cooper's Indy Media program to promote their organization and their upcoming fundraiser event<br />
* Researched and acquired information regarding ways for QUQ to place an insert in the ABQ Water Utility Bill. QUQ secured the 12/2010 slot which can reach over 175,000 customers. Great way to market QUQ and direct people to our website to donate!<br />
* Contacted person at the ABQ Journal about QUQ submitting the application for having a "Brown Paper Bag" spot inside the newspaper. This program is where they highlight a local NPO. Another great marketing tactic and fundraiser strategy. (FREE)<br />
* Mike and I had a progressive phone conference/meeting with Karen Koch about her possibly submitting her films to Encantada TV and for her to possibly become a QUQ board member (use her connections in the Film Industry and fundraising ideas)<br />
* Created a logo advertisment for Bryan Konefsky's upcoming Experimental Cinema FF (ad to be placed in their program) and a logo slide for Friends of Film, Video, and Arts LOL Film Festival--ad will be on-screen.<br />
* Edited and updated the Master Outreach Document with filmmakers I have helped to outreach to and have them submit their films to Encantada TV (Justin Hunt, Tristan Love, Gavin Gistelle). Their films are featured length.<br />
* Edited brochure and printed off 500 copies and folded them for the upcoming outreach events. Put together 3 different folders and brought the IMac, promo DVD and banner--(1.) FoFVA LOL FF--folder had brochures, submission forms, etc, (2) Digital Arts Conference, (3) Fiery Foods Show<br />
* Mar 5-7 wknd--Hosted table/booths at these events and networked amongst the other exhibitors and attendees. At the Fiery Foods Show it was more effective to walk around introducing myself and to talk about QUQ while I was at the same time videotaping the event. I acquired over 15 interviews and taped a lot of behinds the scene footage. Great outreach opportunity amongst the art and food communities in NM and beyond. The Digital Arts conference was more effective for networking with other exhibitors than the students/attendees.<br />
* Worked with Steve on filling out my 6month evaluation survey and to reapply for hosting my VISTA position<br />
* Inserted all the business cards I received over the weekend at the outreach events into Facil<br />
* Researched funding information through the foundation center website--compiled that for Steve<br />
* Captured and edited together Media Literacy Project's Press Conference footage of their Universal Broadband Campaign<br />
* Steve and I met with Tito Chavez--organized a committee to work on a state-wide HS Film Festival. Great opportunity for Encantada TV to become the main distributor for the films and to use this project as evidence to show Comcast Encantada TV should be picked up on comcast channels state-wide &amp; for NM Filmmakers to submit their films for broadcast<br />
* Followed up with Caroline Orcutt from Digital Arts Dept @ UNM about QUQ hosting Community TV Production courses through their program. Expand the student base and better legitimatize our partnership with UNM and our trainings<br />
*Met with members from Enlace Comunartio about partnering with CitizenSchools to help youth/students learn media production so they can start producing their own media!</p>
<p>On that happy note, I hope everyone is doing well &amp; enjoying their positions! I also hope you are learning as much as you are giving to your organization!</p>
<p>Chat soon!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
Erica Jones</p>

				<p>Where to begin? Well I am much better since my last field report. I have come to peace with my work and have come to accept that I just need to take it one step at a time without pressuring myself all the time. It has worked so far. :)</p>
<p>Currently I am still working with the Club Leaders, making new weekly lessons for the after school programs. We are also partnering with our local rape crisis center and they are giving us a free training on how to deal with difficult situations like risky behavior and dangerous situations. Since we deal with girls we face a lot of these challenges. The girls so far have learned how to make their own audio production and are moving into film making activities. They are going to create a talk show, a telenovela (Mexican soap opera) and a parody on American Next Top Model. That should be fun!</p>
<p>During Spring Break we had a spring break camp for teen girls in where they came in and had hands on activities using photography, radio production and filmmaking. They wrote and directed a novela and even edited the film. You can check it out here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnyINwFE4yw">Dos Mujeres</a>. It's hilarious! The cool thing is that the girls got into it and they had guest speakers from many communication fields that inspired them.</p>
<p>There's a lot of fun stuff happening with the girls and even here at the office. My boss makes every intern get a mylatinitas profile (our social network) and write daily blogs and I refused to for a while. I had many ideas but I don't consider myself much of a blogger. I was convinced and now I am part of a <a href="http://www.mylatinitas.com/profiles/blogs/living-in-a-virtual-world-and<br />
">Blog Series </a>. Two blog series to be exact. One is called Living in a Virtual World where I blog weekly about how now we live pretty much virtually, from texting to checking your Farmville 90 times a day. My monthly blog is called Immigration 101 and it's just something I am passionate about and it's more of an awareness blog on immigrant issues and how they live in the shadows. So check it out and let me know what you think!</p>

				<p>LTSC (and quite a few other CA orgs) lost out on a big time federal grant.  We're facing a pretty big budget shortfall, and a bunch of projects and plans are going to have to be slimmed down or eliminated in order to keep core programs afloat.</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, I've been putting together a curriculum packet to train resident volunteers in networking.  The plan was to offer a small stipend, but now that we don't have that to give, I'm gonna change the recruitment strategy a bit (beg beg beg, and/or possibly find a business who'd be willing to donate something).</p>
<p>Was also planning to fix one of the residential networks.  Without any money for equipment, this will be difficult.  But rummaging around, I found a bunch of unused network equipment... hope to make this work.</p>
<p>My plan for the next few months will include time spent on trying to figure out how to make other tech programs and projects (ones that I previously wasn't directly involved in, such as our CTCs) stay aloft and be as sustainable as possible.  I feel like CTCs are often on a knife's edge when it comes to keeping open and functional, and I think we should start to explore partnerships outside of LTSC's usual realm (there's a lot of turning inward to Little Tokyo/JA organizations, I feel).</p>
<p>My supervisor's replacement has been hired and is going to start working sometime in March I think.  Hopefully the transition goes well.</p>
<p>Also, these are awesome and have been a little bit useful for residents with external wifi adapter antennas:<br />

				<p>This Month's Work<br />
Another full month of projects and programs.  We had our annual staff retreat where Colleen did a training on how to enter data into CiviCRM (which we used for our holiday mailing of 5700+ addresses between our two offices) among other marketing, communication and organization specific activities.  We laid the groundwork to begin two seminar series in Sacramento (an interactive youth centric one and another that's technology focused).  Furthermore, we are working on connecting our two youth run business initiatives (which we will be meeting with the other office in February to discuss and action plan) and making it a more prominent aspect of our organization's website.</p>
<p>Challenges<br />
Challenges up until now have been project related.  Knowing what expectations, goals and who my counterparts are as well as who has the ultimate say.  What I created was an internal Work Order Form so people can know who is in charge of what and the steps that need to happen to get a product finished as well as a way to focus projects into more manageable tasks.</p>
<p>Coming Months<br />
I am in charge of several projects in the coming months: creating a sponsorship packet and raising funds for our upcoming annual Premiere in May, designing an annual report and creating a video about our afterschool program California Voices to be used for marketing and enrollment purposes.</p>

				<p>One of our farmers lost his mom in the Haiti earthquake.  We did some fundraising here so that he could travel down and help his family.  Adisson is originally from Haiti and started our program here at NESFP in 2008.  </p>
<p><a href="http://nesfp.nutrition.tufts.edu/farmer/haiti.html" title="http://nesfp.nutrition.tufts.edu/farmer/haiti.html">http://nesfp.nutrition.tufts.edu/farmer/haiti.html</a></p>
<p>On a happier note, the distance learning aspect of my assignment is heating up.  We found some software that will allow us to capture screen videos.  One important element in the small business course is the use of spreadsheets.  Our educator is creating the bulk of the distance learning material on her computer.    She wanted the ability to record the screen and talk at the same time, basically walking a student through the use of financial planning spreadsheets.  In comes CamStudio.  This open source software is awesome!  You can assign a specific area of the screen for recording.  It captures both audio and screen video.  Moving spreadsheets are just one element in the distance learning course.  I feel like these classes will be very exciting to take as we are incorporating a lot of visual elements to help people learn.  Another element of distance learning is the posting of seminars that NESFP hosts.  Yesterday we held a day long seminar on how to run a Mobile Poultry Processing Unit (MPPU).  This unit is essential in the production of free range poultry.  Organic bird farmers can hire this unit to arrive at their site and process their poultry.  Through recording these seminars, NESFP hopes to create a virtual lending library on their website so that students will have access to additional resources.  I have been using Dogooder.tv to host long format videos.  It's a free video hosting service for non-profits.</p>

				<p>Dear Broadband Stimulus,</p>
<p>Where are you?</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Everyone but the peeps who already found out about their application.</p>
<p>This month, we had the Computer Adoption Program class a couple Saturdays ago.  The machines were pretty old, and there were a few hiccups, but I think it went okay.  The students were residents from two LTSC-managed affordable housing projects.  Most were adults, some of whom had never owned or used a computer before.  It was a 4-hour crash course in Ubuntu, and they were all browsing the internet and creating e-mail accounts by the end.  Once they all went home, their computers were wifi ready...which is great, because most of the residents live at Reno, where we recently installed the broadband over powerline network.  It's holding up, even with the increased usage, so yay!</p>
<p>I have been having some issues with our wifi hotspot management system, though.  We recently switched to the free version of Coova so that we could better track usage for grant reporting.  I was a noob and didn't test it out on Internet Explorer.  Older versions of IE seem not to accept redirection (this might also be a Windows-related security issue?).  Going to have to try to work around this.  We can't go to everyone and troubleshoot this problem...perhaps we could offer firefox cds...?  Coova support is not very good, either.  I wouldn't go with them again.</p>
<p>Next up...increasing signal in a huge apartment complex (using DIY parabolic dishes?), a plan to train a few ueber tech savvy residents in wifi maintenance, and hopefully more web design.  Hope everyone is having a happy new year so far!</p>

				<p>The rest of the University seems to be on vacation, so I've been in a relatively quiet office for the few weeks. It's nice to not have distractions, but its lonely, too.</p>
<p>I told myself I'd take the time to catch up on the projects that I never seem to have time to do, like writing field reports. What it's turned into is a lot of grant writing, to try and get a program up and off the ground. The program should be amazing. Its a program to teach high school aged youth to make and distribute short documentary films.</p>
<p>I hate grant writing. Its tedious and I always worry that I'm doing it wrong. It feels awkward writing praise about myself and my organization. Looking at descriptions of the programming, I think "Is our work really that cool? Do all those buzzwords really describe us?" Its not that I don't think my organization does good work. We do awesome work. But I don't like finding grants and then trying to make it sound like we do what the grants want.</p>
<p>To build capacity, I think what my org needs most is another staff person. Someone to do purely administrative and fiscal business. Its much easier to find volunteers to teach and run programs than it is to find volunteers to organize and keep track of files.</p>

				<p>Last friday I had the opportunity to attend a Greenhouse &amp; Winter Growing workshop hosted by my org (New Entry Sustainable Farming Project).  I also videotaped this class.  The idea is to capture more of the on-going workshops and seminars that are given through NESFP.  I am testing the capacity of the Mac that I use for work.  It appears to be slow on converting long videos for web posting.  As a time management technique, I have started converting files overnight.  The VHS library has successfully been converted to DVD for preservation and lending library expansion.  We decided to use Vimeo as a video hosting site.  I like Vimeo because it looks fantastic (compared to youtube..in my opinion).  We will still use Youtube for exposure, and Vimeo for hosting and posting.  The "farmer to farmer" moments have been postponed for the time being..mainly because it has been difficult to find farmers who are also interested in talking on camera about their successes and misgivings.  We have one captured, which will suffice for now.  We plan on capturing more in 2010.  Also, we will be hiring a graphic designer to help polish the Workshops.  These videos will have diagrams and simple animations to help explain some farming processes.  We are researching video host sites that will allow us to host secure video content..content that will only be accessed by paying students through distance learning.  Any insight into this topic would be helpful.   Also, I am booked for NTEN in April!  That is my update.  A final thought on 2009.. Volunteering full-time is rewarding and challenging.. I feel that I am contributing to the capacity of my org.  Happy Holidays!</p>

				<p>Projects are mostly slowing to a pausing point as the holidays and a little offtime approaches.  Am prepping donated computers for the upcoming computer literacy/computer adoption class and following up with the participants.</p>
<p>My supervisor is leaving sometime around the end of January, so things are a little tenuous.</p>
<p>The broadband over powerline (BPL)/open mesh network is up and running really well.  The problem was isolated to the cable modem/ISP.  I put a power timer on it, so that its power cycles late at night.  So far, so good.  The BPL network itself has not had any problems except for a little bit of interference.  Check it out:<br />

<p>I also redeployed a network.  We converted from Meraki brand to Open Mesh brand at Angelina Apartments, with the hope that usage tracking will be easier (not to mention that the new units should have fewer outages and better range).  It's working...so far.</p>
<p>My organization recently switched to gmail for their internal mail, so I've been setting up some google sites as document repositories for wireless/community broadband docs and forms that didn't seem relevant to the more public wiki.</p>
<p>Hope everyone enjoys these last few days of 2009!</p>

				<p>It's December (hooray)! And almost Christmas, so I've been helping to plan the staff holiday party at SEDC. My coworkers and I decorated the office for Christmas, and we will order Asian food from a new Cambodian restaurant (one of my coworkers can get us a discount).  We have also created a slide show with pictures of staff members and funny captions--well, at least, we find them funny.  We created a video of staff members by telling them we were "testing out the camera to see if it works."  So we will also show a movie at the staff party.  Finally, we are having a Secret Santa so that staff members can give each other gifts.</p>
<p>Our turkey drive for Thanksgiving was even more successful than we'd hoped.  We received gift certificates for 25 turkeys costing $10 each from Salvation Army.  When we took the gift certificates to Shaw's to redeem them, Shaw's was having a sale on turkeys, so for the same amount of money ($10 per turkey) we were able to purchase almost 50 turkeys! I wrote a "Thank You" letter to the organizations that donated turkeys, and I will be including the "Thank You" note in SEDC's newsletter and on our website.</p>
<p>Our clothing drive has also been wildly successful!  I sent emails to different colleges in Providence, and Johnson and Wales University and Brown University agreed to have a clothing drive for SEDC.  We received only a few clothes from Brown, but Johnson and Wales students gave us many beautiful clothes!  The clothes were so nice that some of the staff members joked that they couldn't find anything that nice in the stores.  We gave away the clothing on the same day as the turkey giveaway, and by the end of the day, nearly all of the clothes were gone (the only ones left were items like size 0 jeans, which, let's by honest, almost no one can fit into).</p>
<p>I have also been helping to coordinate the translation of our "Welcome to the Socio-Economic Development Center for Southeast Asians," which says those words in Hmong, Lao, Khmer, and Vietnamese.  The U.S. Census Bureau paid for the sign, but they didn't have Hmong, Lao, Khmer, and Vietnamese fonts. I had to email them the correct fonts.  In the process of doing this, I discovered that the staff members at SEDC have different versions of Khmer fonts on their computers, so other staff members and I attempted to correct this and give everyone the same fonts.</p>
<p>I visited SEDC's Woonsocket office and wrote biographies of the staff in that office to put on the website.</p>
<p>I also began looking for interns for spring semester.  My plan is to have the interns work on updating the website and writing the newsletter.  Then, after I leave, SEDC can either rehire the same interns or find new interns to do this task.  I plan to train another staff member in how to  perform these tasks so that she can train the interns and manage the program after I leave.</p>

				<p>Project</p>
<p>MEDIA ARTS CENTER SAN DIEGO is a nonprofit organization providing mentoring and training programs for youth in the predominantly Latino communities of San Diego.  The program will provide digital media arts training and mentoring to youth who live in these communities. MEDIA ARTS CENTER SAN DIEGO’S goal is to provide youth with the knowledge, skills, and abilities that will enable them to successfully join the workforce in the field of digital media arts. In addition, the program will match young people with mentors who will foster in the youth a commitment to excellence, strong interpersonal skills, and a sense of hope in their future success.</p>
<p>Latest Happenings</p>
<p>Media Arts Center San Diego received a $32,000 grant from the James Irvine Foundation to provide training to students to allow them to create Do-It-Yourself media arts projects.  Currently, we are preparing to offer digital media arts classes and workshops to disadvantaged youth in underserved San Diego communities. </p>
<p>Challenges</p>
<p>Almost all of my time is devoted to finding project funding. Without funding, nothing happens, so this is the priority for now.</p>
<p>Resources</p>
<p>All day, every day I write letters of interest and grant proposals to potential funders.  I'm using Foundation Directory Online and Foundation Search to identify foundations that would be receptive to grant proposals.</p>
<p>The Future</p>
<p>Securing funding for this project will continue to be a major challenge. For the forseeable future, I will continue to identify potential funders and seek their support.</p>

				<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>Wow, this last month has gone by extremely quickly. Things have been going well, and I'm going to focus this report on a single opportunity that has come up that I am particularly excited about.</p>
<p>First off, the CSL had its first formal fundraiser and it went extremely well. Kudos to Carolyn for organizing it. At the fundraiser, I met with one of our board members who happens to be a tenured professor at Umass Lowell. I explained to him my thoughts on our problems getting quality volunteers and suggested a solution that I'd been kicking around in my head for awhile: setting up a Work Study program with UML students for the CSL. We get qualified workers, and they get experience working on actual production code and working within a development cycle. Fred, the board member, was interested in the idea and asked me to write up a two paragraph abstract. I wrote something up and sent it to him the following day.</p>
<p>Fred liked it and decided to give it the go-ahead, changing it from a Work Study to a 1 credit course. I now have to come up with a 14 week curriculum and will be responsible to running to first semester of the program. Quite exciting, although considering I'll be teaching material that I mostly just learned 3 months ago, also a bit frightening. I'm currently working on constructing a rough course syllabus that I hope to have completed by Friday, and from there I'll have to flesh out the particulars of what I am going to go over at each weekly session as well as make sure the code base is in a state that an outsider can work on prior to the beginning of next semester. Lots of work, but if I can pull it off I think this will be a huge boon for the CSL and definitely is a way that I can leave a solid lasting impression after my year is up. We'll see how it goes!</p>

				<p>This past Saturday, the wifi network that is a lovechild between the brutish broadband over powerline adapters and the delicate, flighty open mesh routers was deployed.  And like any unholy demonspawn, the birth was painful.  It seemed to be working for an hour, but it promptly went out right as we were leaving.</p>
<p>So, the BPL network so far is a no-go, but the good news (sort of) is that BPL is likely not to blame.  The router that we're using to run the network is your average household netgear.  Even the open mesh router directly connected to the netgear is not working; so likely, this is an issue related to the main router.  I've had problems with netgears handling large amounts of bandwidth in the past, but it's more likely just not allowing the BPL adapters onto the network and will need to simply assign static IPs.  If it's a bandwidth problem that's freezing up the router...well, maybe we'll have to invest in a better router or a switch.  Hopefully we can get the network up before Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>The good thing about the deployment is that the residents at the Reno Building are AWESOME.  So cool, eager to help and to learn, really happy that they'll have free internet.  I've got to say, open mesh/BPL is pretty neat to deploy.  We gave each resident their mesh unit, they placed it and came back downstairs, then we watched each unit come online.  :3</p>
<p>I'm getting a little concerned, however, about the sustainability of some of the things I'm working on.  I'm starting to realize that things like arranging meetings and training tenants in wifi maintenance and network administration are not tasks that we can reasonably expect most of the tenants to do.  It's a lot of work to expect tenants to do.  I'm hoping to come up with a more lasting solution (since when I'm gone, they won't have someone to train residents).   Volunteer recruitment at local schools?  Unpaid internships?  I'm hoping there isn't too much resistance to me seeking out "trainers" to train.  I've been spending a lot of time doing direct service (training tenants, now being asked to help teach a computer literacy class, running tech support errands).  I'm not sure where to draw the line, even though I know there's that magical percentage number.  And if I have to say, "No, can't do that," is there a good way to approach it?   Will see how it goes.</p>

				<p>We have been working on premieres for our summer programming, among other things, for California Voices.  My specific role was to create the promotional flyers and postcards.  A byproduct was putting the new design for the programs on T-Shirts we ended up giving out to the students who participated in the program.</p>
<p>Our biggest challenge we ran into was we wanted to do a six hour premiere with 2 hours going to each of the three parts of the CA Voices Initiative.  We didn't schedule a venue soon enough to hold all three programs so we ended up having to split up into separate venues, dates and times.  This afforded us to have more targeted marketing though, with our Hmong Voices Film Premiere being promoted on a Hmong language heavy TV channel, newspaper and making the front page of the online edition of the city newspaper.  We filled up the venue and it was a great success with over 100 people for the first film premiere we've done in the Sacramento area.  Our Latino Voices Film Premiere will be at a local latino club and will have cultural performances and our Native Voices Film Premiere will be the featured entertainment at a regionally and culturally prestigious banquet in December.</p>
<p>I have also been working with the youth entrepreneurship aspect of our organization, the Youth Empowerment Studio.  Using a youth development model to create a safe place for teens to learn we have about 30 youth between our two offices.  A planning meeting this weekend helped flesh out what the students in our office would like to learn and provide to clients throughout this next year: media conversion, trainings for other non-profits and businesses, videos and some graphic design/web design.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge I've faced with the organization is getting them to use industry standard software.  Its a big expense, but its all about the perceived expertise of the youth and us.  If we are using Adobe software and are Adobe or Apple certified, other organizations and businesses will perceive us as more qualified and more able to provide technical support, which seems to be the direction they want to go.</p>
<p>Finally, I am creating a communication survey to understand how we as an organization process information flow and creation.  From this I will be better able to recommend equipment purchases and further training/ certification we need to undergo.</p>
<p>That's it for now.  Attached is a postcard for our Latino  Voices Film Premiere.</p>

	    <p>Rich,</p>
<p>Big props on the success of your film premiere. Coordinating one event like that, let alone three, is challenging, so, again, much credit for the great job on promotion and getting the local media involved. The use of industry standard software can be kind of contentious in non-profits, especially as you mentioned for cost reasons, but especially if you're running workshops with youth its usually worth it to splurge on better software  to create a skill set that can translate outside the workshop. Hope everything goes well for the Our Latino Voices Film Premiere, the postcard looks great.</p>

				<p>Since my field report was a massive tome detailing a single day's events that had absolutely nothing to do with what I've been working on for the last month, I figured I'd do a follow-up detailing my actual, you know, work. </p>
<p>Things continue to go well at the Community Software Lab. My work has been split primarily between setting up a new Xen Virtualization Server to host a Virtual Machine of a Linux Terminal Server to pave the way for all of our workstations to become thin-clients (man, that probably makes zero sense to anybody reading this), and refactoring some sloppy code to allow for integration between our two production code deployments, <a href="http://www.mvhub.com" title="www.mvhub.com">www.mvhub.com</a> and <a href="http://www.northshoreport.org" title="www.northshoreport.org">www.northshoreport.org</a>. Right now, the mvhub.com site is running an older but more feature-complete version of our backend software and it needs to be migrated from v2 to v3, but in order to do that some of the missing features in v3 of the code need to be ported over. The ultimate goal is to setup a maintainable, structured development cycle for the CSL's codebase and making it so both mvhub and northshoreport run off of the same codebase is the first step towards that effort.</p>
<p>It is looking that my primary focus for the next few months (and perhaps the defining contribution of my VISTA year) will be creating this code development cycle. I am enthusiastic about this work as it follows the VISTA motto of infrastructure building and will definitely leave a lasting impact on the CSL's operations for years to come. Right now, the MVHub software is developed in sort of a hodge-podge, let's-release-whenever-we-feel-like-it way. My plan is first to consolidate the various versions of the code that is deployed on the two production websites into one version, then package the software to be installable as a one simple Debian package (in contrast to the mess of CPAN modules and Debian packages it is now), and lastly construct a monthly release cycle for the debian package leveraging the bazaar-launchpad environment I previously setup. Seems like a lot of work when I type it all out, but I'm hoping to have this all done by the end of January. We'll see how it goes!</p>

				<p>My third month at Prometheus has been a time of increasing responsibility. As a step towards my goal of improving the org’s communication reach, I’ve helped to build a press strategy team. We’ve gotten together some media best practices (writing press releases, etc.) and once we build a digital version of the file I’ll be happy to share it with others here.  I’ve also taken on coordination of our web redesign, supervising our web designer with weekly meetings. Learning to supervise people &amp; projects is a skill I’m hoping to gain, so I’m excited about this. </p>
<p>Another big project this month was helping to create a yearlong workplan for the regulatory policy team, as well as a 10-page descriptive list of our 25 or so regulatory policy issues. I now have a much better birds-eye view of our strategy and goals. We presented our work to the rest of the organization, and everyone felt it was enormously helpful in understanding what the regulatory policy team does. It was the first time anyone had ever compiled a list of all of our issues, so it was a big and welcome step. We’ll be adapting these documents for use on our website soon.</p>

				<p>In month 2 I got in touch with Prometheus' roots with the activity at the core of the organization's mission: I learned to build a transmitter! It felt good to take a step back from regulatory policy docs to pick up a soldering iron for an hour. The means of controlling your own media are surprisingly simple...though influencing the rules that govern media is a little more complicated.</p>
<p>Other highlights included attending the NAMAC conference and the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) radio trade show, where I learned about the broadcasting lobby that is often on the other side of Prometheus on policy issues. Both of these events were very focused on new opportunities with digital media, an interesting topic at low-fi Prometheus. We are working to understand the implications of HD radio on low power community stations, and part of my job is figuring out how to communicate the tricky world of HD policy to the non-engineers of the world. At the NAB conference, it was easy to see that commercial broadcasters are struggling to maintain relevance in a digital world, but it’s also clear to me that the solution is not just the integration of new technology, but the integration of new models that make use of broadcasting’s uniquely local focus. The crisis in the broadcasting industry could make room for new ideas in public media, if we take this opportunity. </p>
<p>Anyway, projects in month 2 included lots of writing and editing, again helping me to build a sense of the org as a whole and informing what I hope will be more capacity-building for our communications outreach in the future. This has included more work on revising the organization's mission, vision, and values statements, general editing and improving of written materials, particularly press releases. Loving the job.</p>

				<p>Yay! I have a desk.  It's made a bigger difference than I expected in my productivity and excitement about coming in to work some mornings.  The feel of having even a little space that's more or less my own is great... maybe I'll even put a few things on the wall in the next few weeks!  In the end, it just took me realizing that it would make a difference to me, and then deciding to establish myself at this unused desk.  Good stuff.</p>
<p>In terms of work, the excitement(?) of this past month has been learning my way around the intricacies of Salesforce, the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform my organization uses to track everything and everyone they have contact with.</p>
<p>I'm working on a system using outside PHP code with Salesforce code and internal pages to sync with MySQL database tables. The goal is to manage the database that will display event calendars on our new website, and also let volunteers interact with that database from the backend to create radio versions of those calendars. Oh yeah, and match up the event venues with our records for those venues and their underwriting / sponsorship history.  No problem.</p>
<p>We've also finished strategic planning here for the next year, including a detailed action plan for my project, rebuilding the website.  That means that for the last few weeks we've had two separate timelines to try to follow -- this action plan and my VAD. I just spent this afternoon coordinating those, which happened more smoothly than I expected. So this month, and here on out, I'll have just one timeline to follow.  That will be good, since trying to coordinate with both meant that I often wasn't totally satisfying either; the unexpected complications of some steps didn't help.</p>
<p>Our fall pledge drive starts in just a few days. Those next ten days will be something of a flashback to my first week here, which happened to also be the special one-week summer pledge drive that happened this year. It's nice to think that I'm so well settled in here now, know my coworkers and my way around, and just generally the way things work. (It's also exciting because there's tons of great food in the office to tempt the 'round the clock phone volunteers; I may not have to buy food for two weeks!)</p>
<p>That's it for now... happy to be transitioning into a more active phase of my year, actually starting to make decisions and build working systems instead of always being in research mode.  And still thinking about next year... I know from experience that there will be plenty of questions about that when I visit family over the holidays!</p>

				<p>It is mid-October and we are still hoping to shoot more video training sessions in the field before winter.  Currently we have two of them shot.  The goal is for three.  We have also talked about shooting a total of four, possibly doing one in the spring.  These instructional videos will be about 20-30 minutes in length.  The first one is on Equipment training (mainly how to run a small farm walk-behind tractor), the second is Irrigation of crops.  I'm learning lots about small farming!  More about the economics of this type of business..the things that people should learn before venturing into their own business.  The third field training that we hope to shoot is on Pest control or weed management.  We have also been shooting 'farmer to farmer' interview moments that will be used in the on-line distance learning modules.  We have captured one of these already, interviewing a recent graduate who is now successfully farming in N. Reading.  Lydia, the recent grad, runs her own CSA (Community supported Ag.) with members.  She distributes to her shareholders in Somerville MA and also in N. Reading.  We hope to shoot one more 'farmer to farmer' moment this month.  Also, the promo slideshow is done and now posted on youtube.com/NESFP</p>
<p>My agency has old VHS training videos from various farm organizations.  I am in the process of transferring these to DVD.  These films and videos are part of their existing lending library.  Converting to DVD will squeeze more life out of the tapes, and make it possible for more people to use at home.  This will be an on-going project throughout the year.</p>
<p>Coming up in the winter months, I'll mainly be editing the training videos.  There is also a plan to help some undergrad students with their senior project film, by contributing existing video footage and access to our farm sites.  It is going to be about sustainable agriculture in MA.  This will give NESFP more visibility with a short documentary film release next spring.</p>
