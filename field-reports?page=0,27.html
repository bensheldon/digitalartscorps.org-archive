				<p>Does anyone know anything about the program that is Audience? I'm slowly trying to figure it out. Slow is the keyword in that sentence.</p>
<p>Right now, it's becoming the most painful experience of my whole entire life. It's also bringing back memories of when I tried to figure out Dreamweaver when I was fifteen and eventually gave up.</p>
<p>I worked with a program similar to it in highschool two years ago when I voluteered at my local public access station. I only say it's similar because it produces the same outcome. The procedures are completely different.</p>
<p>The manual is pretty much a new appendage, going everywhere with me. Unintelligable bullets of playbacks, screens, zones, and magazines. It's not exactly a picture book either. Just bolded words and bullets.</p>
<p>I think this is one program I might have to spend a good amount of time with tutorials (which are nonexistent anywhere except for inside the program) and templates (which I'm pretty much against using).</p>
<p>I'm 15% certain that after my birthday on Sunday, I'll have a newfound knowledge of this program magically because I'll be 20, and this program is probably a right of passage.</p>
<p>I'm 85% certain that all of Tuesday will be taken up with tutorials and photoshopping templates to fit my needs.</p>

				<p>I'm doing a train-the-trainer digital storytelling workshop next month using PC's and probably Windows Movie Maker (or possibly something like Adobe Premiere Elements) and I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations on a microphone ($50 or under) that I could use to get a good, clear voice narration.  My friend Colin recommended using a <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?O=productlist&amp;A=details&amp;Q=&amp;sku=150434&amp;is=REG&amp;addedTroughType=categoryNav<br />
igation">Sony ECM-MS907</a>, but that was on a Mac.   I've tried USB mic's but they usually sound awful.</p>
<p>Ben just got an <a href="http://www.rolandus.com/products/productdetails.aspx?ObjectId=757">Edirol mp3 recorder</a>, which is sweet, but again, out of my budget!  </p>
<p>[Oh and attached is a little bit of what my voice sounds like, recorded by Ben's recorder...I've never lost my voice this badly with a cold before...]</p>

				<p>I think that I have just gotten over my first hump in introducing myself and what my role is in the organization, now it is time for action.  </p>
<p> Here at the Cyber Y computer lab we just hired an intern to help maintain the computers and printers and also help with children when programs are running.  </p>
<p>We are trying to set up a successful &quot;open access&quot; time.  We want to find good ways to advertise to the community that we have open access and also we are looking for good surveys to give to the community to understand what they need and want out of the open access time.  Because we would like to set up computer literacy classes for grown-ups and or seniors citizens.  </p>
<p> So, for the little kiddies after school i am working on implementing a program called Kinetic City.  This children&#39;s computer program is an entertaining way to learn standards-based science. It is the ideal combination  of technology and hands-on collaboration.  Basically, kids learn reading, writing, and basic computer skills along with a little science thrown in.  First though, i need to learn the curriculums and train the existing staff at the YMCA to promote capacity building.  Then i will have groups of kids that will go through the program through out the year. </p>
<p>M y next big goal is to set up a youth media program  during  spring and summer for teens.  Got lots of ideas.  I&#39;m thinking media literacy and media production for girl teens.     </p>

				<p>Hi.  Just an intro for the new vistas, I&#39;ve been working on developing and starting a youth media program at the public access center in Cincinnati.  It started off slow and bit discouraging but it&#39;s starting to gain speed and so on. </p>
<p>Last Wed, I started teaching a video production/media literacy class for a group of high school students from a charter school.  This week would have been week number two, but Cincinnati had a snow emergency on Tues and Wed which also meant a snow day!  (the city shut down early, if that&#39;s possible because of six inches of snow, people freak out with even the mention of snow around here....).  Anyways, I&#39;m basing this class off the Youth Channel&#39;s PSA/documentary curriculum, available on their website <a href="http://digitalartscorps.org/www.youthchannel.org" target="_blank" title="www.youthchannel.org ">www.youthchannel.org </a>.  It&#39;s my first real teaching experience.  And it&#39;s not so bad so far, though I did accidentally say shit, which they thought was a riot.    </p>
<p>I&#39;ve been getting calls from YMCA, afterschool programs, and youth-job training programs about doing some workshops.  I guess it&#39;s just been a matter of talking to people about what I do here and accomodating to their needs, times, and desired outcomes.   </p>
<p> Also recently established is our &#39;youth channel&#39; called the Youth Media Block, shown on our educational access channel tuesdays and thursdays in three blocks of time - 4-6 (for the afterschool crowd), 8-10 (primetime for the university&#39;s broadcast of their news and now we&#39;re getting cinci schools to submit their highschool games) and an afterhours block midnight-2am for the &#39;adultish&#39; content.  I&#39;ve signed up for the <a href="http://www.nymapexchange.net/" target="_blank" title="http://www.nymapexchange.net/">NYMAP- youth video exchange network</a> that Danielle has mentioned so that I can get a stream of content from other access centers.  We&#39;ll be making and sharing some productions out of the &#39;nati soon. </p>
<p> Oh - here&#39;s 2 tutorials I put together for my Saturday program - Youth Media Lab.   Ummm.  yah.    One tutorial is a brief intro to the mac, about the desktop, where to find applications and and different view modes.  It&#39;s pretty basic.  I&#39;ll be expanding it soon.  The other one is an activity using Photoshop Elements, or you can use Photoshop.  If you have the newest macs with photobooth, it encorporates that but is not necessary.   Feel free to alter as you see fit.  I&#39;m working on an iMovie tutorial... .   It seems i can only upload the photoshop one right now.  the other one is too large because of the pictures.  if you&#39;re interested in the other one, email me.    </p>

	    <p>Maybe you know about this, but there&#39;s a button to compress the pictures in a Word (or Powerpoint) document on the &quot;picture&quot; toolbar (it shows up when you click on a picture, or when you right-click a picture and tell it to show the toolbar). It looks like a box with arrows pointing in at the corners. Word tends to save as much info as possible about a picture, so this can really reduce the size; one of my recent documents with a single PNG went from 3MB to .5MB.</p>

				<p><a href="http://museum.mit.edu/mwow" target="_blank" title="MIT Museum Withouth Walls"><img src="http://museum.mit.edu/cmp/files/images/lbst.png" alt="" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="171" height="110" align="right" /></a>When people ask me (as they inevitably do when they find out I'm a full time volunteer) why I do VISTA, I often cite the ways it connects me to groups and people that I could have never imagined I could meet doing a regular job. In fact, my work this year doing digital storytelling facilitation and other related projects for <a href="http://www.massimpact.org">MassIMPACT</a> came out of meeting Natasha Friedus (of <a href="http://www.creativenarrations.net/">Creative Narrations</a>) at UMass Boston and getting myself invited to her second <a href="http://massimpact.org/projects/digital_storytelling/index.shtml">Spreading the Stories train-the-trainer workshop</a> last year. And so it was how I ended up at the <a href="http://museum.mit.edu">MIT Museum</a> this past week, working with able fellow facilitator Lisa Dush of Story Builders, UMass Amherst, and MIT in the fall. We were asked by Cesar McDowell of MIT's <a href="http://crcp.mit.edu/index.php">Center for Reflective Community Practice</a> to help out with the new <a href="http://museum.mit.edu/mwow">Museum Without Walls </a>project.</p>
<p>Museum Without Walls (MWOW) is an interesting approach to bringing the museum experience out of the museum, approaching the entire MIT campus like a potential historical and personal tour and reflection space. Using adapted video players with WIFI access and GPS, the project aspires to have visitors walk the campus and access a rich library of video and still content based on their physical location by 2011. Since it's MIT, the gadgets will certainly be innovative and the stories unique, but the interdisciplinary idea of museum content that could change as users add and walk around with it piqued my personal interest in placed based storytelling.</p>
<p><a href="http://museum.mit.edu/" target="_blank" title="MIT Museum"></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ctcvistaqueen/379545014/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/144/379545014_3c38ba9dbf_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Otto with Lisa" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></a>Our small digital storytelling workshop was billed not only as a pilot to create MIT place based stories, but as a <a href="http://web.mit.edu/iap/overview/">Independent Activities Period</a> (IAP) offering. (I learned later through one of the stories that this is a way for MIT students and staff to explore small subject explorations in the time between fall and spring semesters.) We set up a workspace in a long exhibit space, so that our story circle and laptop workspaces were surrounded by antique single lensed microscopes. In fact, this full immersion in the to Museum became a quiet theme to the week, where we were invited into the archives to find images and I passed by Harold Edgerton photos and holographs on my way to the bathroom.</p>
<p>Our host Otto Loggers gathered a group of graduate students from the HASTS (History, Anthropology, and Science, Technology &amp; Society), Urban Planning, and Biology programs, sprinkled in with a staff from the Alumni office. In the beginning, Lisa and I were curious on how we could balance the desire to include historical references and facts with authentic narratives usually characterized in digital stories. The fear is always that participants will lean toward professional, objective tales and away from more personal stories, but this group also had the challenge of being the pilot stories in the MWOW project. We decided to go with the flow and see where the participants' stories and group's dynamics took us. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ctcvistaqueen/379544343/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/164/379544343_c7d269b9b5_s.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="Danger Laser Beam sign" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ctcvistaqueen/379544149/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/183/379544149_e4aa7ba5e5_s.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="Red Coat" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></a>I'm glad to report that the group came together well, still bringing a myriad of tones, purposes, and expressions. While one PhD student mused  why MIT isn't more focused on environmental sustainability, another detailed her participation on huge, puzzle riddled annual Mystery Hunt. Another student candidly discussed her emotions around being an Iranian student at MIT and shared a table with fellow HAST student who hysterically chronicled her initial days of getting hopelessly lost in the maze of MIT's buildings. One story even connected MIT to Lawrence and Lowell through past funders and current initiatives. Even the stories about alumni and IAP featured personal touches such as famous crimson red jacket and a &quot;borrowed&quot; sign warning of laser beams. (As soon at the stories come out of post-production and the MWOW folks figure out next steps of getting the pieces online, I'll include a link here.) </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ctcvistaqueen/379545253/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/379545253_30d60f90d3_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Rebecca" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></a>The usual stress of learning a new form of expression coupled with new technologies was a bit increased when we learned that most of the participants were Mac folks and we were confined to the Windows laptops we were able to procure. But I always make the argument that the stories can be made with even the most rudimentary tools and keeping it simple never hurts. So even when Windows Movie Maker crashed and the participants started to perfect the Day 3 hunch over their machines, I told them to be patient, stretch and take breaks, and save often (Ctrl S is your friend). In three days, they not only made seven 3-5 minutes long digital stories, Lisa introduced the group to audio editing in Audacity and we managed to scan quite a few photos and artifacts for both the stories and the Museum's digital archives as well. </p>
<p>In a stroke of luck, we invited the Museum staff that had opened the doors for us or researched our topics in the archives to come see the finished pieces. I say this was lucky because they were such a gracious and appreciative audience - especially friend Adam Holt who's excited about the possibilities of this project to combine digital storytelling and mapping. These staff had seen us around the last three days, but they had no idea that we were working on such &quot;gems&quot; of MIT's history funneled through personal experience. After a frazzled afternoon of harried video editing, these compliments soothed our storytellers and got them thinking about how they could take digital storytelling back to their departments and projects as the next semester begins this week.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ctcvistaqueen/379543940/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/132/379543940_e37633c8d9_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="MWOW Group" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" /></a>This workshop  was a good break for me from working with youth or community organizers, strictly because the mind sets seemed so different. MIT students seem strangely focused on their individual studies and programs yet still connected with so many aspects of the world and the environment. By throwing a personal narrative process into this mix, Lisa and I created a space that yielded new challenges and benefits for me as a facilitator. The juxtaposition of the microscopic and global mind sets created a compelling challenge as we revised the stories based on the perceived audience and intended point of view. And the idea that personal reflection should be tempered with historical and archival facts and context both limited and expanded the impact of each story differently. </p>
<p>The next step is determining how I can bring this new both PLACE and HISTORICAL mind set  into the next set of train-the-trainer workshops I'm trying to do this spring with housing developments and community organizations in Boston and Springfield. </p>

				<p>I have been reluctant to blog not only because it is a bit foreign to me and I don&#39;t know what other people want to hear about me, or if they even care, but mostly because it is available to the public. I would like to share many of my experiences with my fellow VISTAs; however, I am uncomfortable sharing my life and experiences with everyone on the Internet. I also feel like I am restricted to blogging about only the positive things that occur at my organization, what about the not-so-positive ones, the things that aren&#39;t going quite so perfectly? Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love my org, and know far too well that everything does not always go as planned, and the wonderful experiences I have had thus far completely outweight the less-wonderful ones, but I would like to share those too, and more importantly the lessons that I have learned from them in hopes that another VISTA may benefit. Imagine though, if someone from my organization were to read that blog, I fear that that could create some uncomforatble situations for me.</p>
<p>I am sure that other VISTAs are experiencing similiar situations, or at least ones you feel you can&#39;t blog about. I think that we could benefit from having an outlet to vent our frustrations, and share creative ideas and solutions. This forum would greatly benefit by having the option of a private blog section for VISTAs only.   </p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if I am alone in this and would appreciate your feedback or support.</p>

	    <p>Hi ladies,</p>
<p>I'd love to read what you're working on...especially since you haven't blogged much since the PSO...I have no idea what you've been working on or how it's going.  And there's a big glob of new VISTAs that might be interested in your 5 months of experience...</p>
<p>If you are having issues at your org, you should be immediately talking them over with your VISTA Leader and/or the Project HQ staff.  That's our jobs to listen and offer help.  The mailing list and your monthly conference calls are also places where you can poll your fellow VISTAs to get feedback.</p>
<p>The blogs are a place for us to talk about our service, both the triumphs and the challenges, but it is still a public forum that represent both you and the Project in the web sphere.  We're trying to come up with a communications policy that works for everyone on the new wiki (<a href="http://www.ctcvista.org/node/450" title="http://www.ctcvista.org/node/450">http://www.ctcvista.org/node/450</a>).  In years past, we used to have a private blog, but it became a negative space that was dominated by rants and flame wars, and we found out that few of VISTAs read it regularly.</p>
<p>Here's an example -  a new VISTA, Leena, in the digital media group, posted a very candid blog about her challenges explaining to the local YMCA staff what her VISTA role is, and we discussed it on the  conference call and at the MA Area monthly meeting yesterday.  She's still got the challenge, but she reached out and I hope she's feeling supported.</p>

				<p>I've been playing around with tag and word clouds lately.  Clouds are basically interesting (and esthetically appealing, in my opinion) ways to visualize the prevalence of words. Words that are more prevalent show up larger/darker than more rare ones.  Oftentimes you will see Tag Clouds which show how many posts there are in certain categories (we have one on the <a href="http://ctcvista.org/digest/fall06">CTC VISTA Digest</a>).</p>
<p>Below is a word cloud made up of <em>all</em> the posts on CTCVISTA.org.  This isn't the categories, but the actual posts themselves.  It was created by a very nifty website call <a href="http://digitalartscorps.org/TagCrowd.com">TagCrowd.com</a>.</p>
<p>An interesting side note is that, excluding common words (<em>and, like, the, pronouns, etc.</em>), we have a lexicon of 7,369 unique words on the website.</p>

				<p>Wow has it been awhile since I logged on here and talked about whats going on in Arizona.  We hit a heat wave out here and its in the 80&#39;s for the rest of the week.  I have been really busy working on stuff at the club and really have become a member of the staff these last few months.  The members here have really warmed up to me and I am starting to remember names of kids better.  So I guess I better recap what has happened in the last 2 months.</p>
<p>December was pretty rough to start.  I was doing a lot more direct service then I really wanted to do.  I wanted to do things that I did not have a lot of time for due to the fact that I was so busy keeping an area open or something along those lines.  My comrade in the computer lab has totally different habits when it comes to cleanliness in our computer lab and that causes us some troubles and some strife but we worked out a list of clean up chores to do at night and we also got some of our middle school aged members as helpers to make sure that we are looking good in the computer lab at all times.  We were having a great deal of trouble trying to get the members interested in the programs we were running and it was starting to get to be a drag.  What we thought was a problem with our program is actually pretty common when it comes to after school activities.  You hope for the best and plan for the worst.  The kids are not as interested in doing &quot;organized&quot; activities after school.  Its a struggle for all BGCs. </p>
<p>I flew home for Christmas break and spent a week there.  When I came back I had a winter break were we had less then 20 kids in the computer lab all day.  This was a good opportunity for me to change the room around.  The room was 7 computers on one wall and 5 computers on the other wall.  I changed it to where the computers are set up in groups of three.  It makes the room look more spacious.  I think it is allows for more space for each member for their computer.  This took the better part of two days because each individual computer had a carpeted divider.   We also had alot of trouble with computers crashing after I changed everything around.  I am not sure what is causing the problems but if anyone has MAXTOR brand hard drives in their computers be sure to back everything on your computer up.  I have had nothing but trouble with this drives in particular.  I have had at least 4 computers with disk errors in the last month.  One computer had a power supply failure.  Lots of these computers are booting and saying that there it no operating system.  I do not know if this is do to shutting the computers off at night or if its due to changing everything around.  I am trying to test the theory of making sure that the computers stay on at night.  We are currently looking at making only 4 computers in the lab IE enabled.  This is so that we can constantly monitor those kids who are on the Internet without worrying about not being able to see what they are on.  This month we have been hitting the kids with new programs along with CAP and HACK.  We added Sony Acid Pro to the mix for the teens and they really seem to enjoy mixing beats.  For the younger ones we just started doing Movie Maker and we had a pretty good turnout for the first meeting of that.  The members are started to get the idea the the computer lab is not just a place to come and play games on the Internet but also a place to have fun with other programs. </p>
<p> Couple other things I am working on right now is trying to get some new furniture for our computer lab.  I would like to get the computer chairs with caster wheels.  It would be nice to get a oval table for the center of our room that can be painted a bright color.  I would also like to get our room painted something other then off-white.  I would do anything to get the dirty walls painted.  We also got some storage lockers and I am just waiting on our maintenance man to put the locks in them so we can have our valuable equipment locked up at the end of every night.  </p>
<p> Alot to throw at you and I have pictures of how the lab looks now.  I will post pictures later when I can log on to flickr.  Right now at work it is blocked...along with everything else.</p>

				<p>One of my more recent projects has been re-working the network map for the local community wireless network.  My efforts thus far can be found at <a href="http://map2.cuwireless.net" title="http://map2.cuwireless.net">http://map2.cuwireless.net</a>.  Credit for the CSS and the text accompanying the map goes to Ross.  This is just the first part.  The next stage is to add an admin/management interface.</p>
<p> The map is powered by PHP and the Google Maps API (which uses javascript).  The Google Maps API is incredibly easy to use and has lots of features.</p>
<p> For anyway who is interested, this little project will be distilled into an open-source package once it is complete (should be sometime this month).</p>

				<p>Our fellow VISTA, Carl, sent me a website for a great airfare finder: <a href="http://www.farecast.com/" target="_blank" title="Farecast">http://www.farecast.com/</a></p>
<p>It&#39;s pretty cool because it not only tells you where to find the cheapest fare, but gives advice on whether to buy now or later based on trends in airfare prices. If you haven&#39;t bought your airfare for the conference yet, I definitely suggest you check it out. </p>
<p>Thanks for the help Carl! (Especially since he lives in DC and doesn&#39;t even have to travel. What a swell guy!) </p>

				<p>I dont know if ya&#39;ll are aware of this, but <a href="http://www.thebeehive.org/">www.thebeehive.org</a> has a link that directs you to free tax preparation and info to see if you qualify for the earned income tax credit. I used it, saved $50 or so, and got the EIC. It was pretty easy and all electronic. All you need is a copy of last years tax return and your bank information and yer set to go. </p>
<p>That refund will go a long ways!</p>
<p>I apologize if everyone knows about the beehive already, but that site is really quite something. A valuable resource thats worth repeating for eveyone who is in-the-know.</p>

They have clients that are 5 employees and hundreds, from Girl Scouts of America to Computer CORE (5 employees). The database software is called ETO (Efforts to Outcomes) and is built around the idea of tracking successes and clients. </p>
<p>Shoot me an email if you have any other questions. <a href="mailto:ceseifert@gmail.com">ceseifert@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>Later!</p>

<p>Thanks for the info.  I&#39;m scouting out a lot of options, and this certainly helps.  Hope all is well in DC -- looking forward to seeing everyone at the conference! </p>

				<p>I just moved from the Community Organizing group to the Technical Assistance (TA) for Nonprofits group because I'm doing web and TA work rather than anything related to fundraising or outreach. I was one of the two note-takers on this month's conference call; my notes are after the jump.</p>
<h3>Notes on the TA for Nonprofits (group) conference call</h3>
<h4>February 2, 2006</h4>
<ul>
<li>Kevin (in Miami) talked about the January PSO&mdash;"The PSO was a lot of fun." It was long, but nice to see people's faces and what they're doing. There were presentations on community wireless, copyright laws, and creating podcasts (others have blogged about the presentations).</li>
<li>Karl (in San Francisco) is at NTEN, and has been involved in setting up their conference coming up in April (that we have been hashing out the logistics of getting to/staying at). He had been to a regular VISTA PSO when he started his term of service in October. The major benefit to the CTC VISTA Project PSO was meeting people who are working in the similar fields to his.</li>
<li>Ross is at a community wireless network organization; they build their own open source wireless network meshing software, but most of his recent work has been "creating an organization out of the organization"&mdash;forming a board, getting oversite and coordinating participants' actions. He also works with communities, both in the US and internationally, to put up wireless networks. Potential connection: John's organization in Lowell, MA is wanting to put together a wireless network for downtown Lowell.</li>
<li>Matt from somewhere talked, but there was wicked static on the conference line and especially over everything he said.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aliya asked us what the most fun thing we've been doing since the last conference call was, or about a major success we've had since then:</p>
<ul>
<li>John: setting up a testing/virtual server, with a whole bunch of DNS/web/directory servers. He is becoming a McGuyver addict (putting his physics degree to "work")</li>
<li>Kamala: hasn't been having fun with her home computer. She has been working with PHP and MySQL. Potential connection: me! I have been doing some work with PHP and MySQL as well.</li>
<li>Cheryl (in North Carolina): has been working with Plone, but more importantly she successfully planted basil and oregano. Also, there is a mouse in her office. (<a href="http://glass.typepad.com/journal/2005/09/how_to_catch_a_.html">this kind of mousetrap</a> might work...)</li>
<li>Tim (in San Francisco) has been working on getting a new version of <a href="http://www.socialsourcecommons.org/">Social Source Commons</a> out. He hasn't been involved in planning it, but his organization is having a "coding conference" (?) in Oakland at the end of February, that will talk about assisting (or maybe actually assist?) people who want to use technology in advocacy work.</li>
<li>Laura and Corey (in San Diego?) have been taking a Dreamweaver class, and are starting a Photoshop class next week. They're developing an online system to track how kids are doing in Advanced Placement (AP) courses. They did a demo the other week which worked out "pretty well..." School loans are fixed (congrats!)</li>
<li>Andrea has been trying for a month or two to get volunteers to teach computer courses. She'll be taking a Dreamweaver class starting next (this) week. She's been taking advantage of the yoga classes that her organization offers the community (hey! my organization should start holding yoga classes!)</li>
<li>Then I talked; since I&#39;m new to the TA for Nonprofits group, I introduced myself: My term of service started in September. I&#39;m from Maine, but serving in Sacramento, CA at the <a href="http://calruralhousing.org/">California Coalition for Rural Housing</a> (CCRH). I&#39;ve been wrapping up work on a new website (watch that space!). In the past two weeks I&#39;ve started making phone calls and talking to people who&#39;ve attended community mapping trainings that the organization (specifically, my supervisor Darryl) holds as part of our CRATE program. I&#39;ll be putting together a &quot;rural housing toolbox&quot; from their feedback, and from plans laid out in some grants—it will be a bunch of online resources (both on our website and links to other sites) relevant to affordable housing in rural Californian communities. I&#39;ve also been working on a database of Inclusionary Housing policies (basically: community requirements that a portion of any new housing be &quot;affordable&quot;) from California communities, which will be on our website; I&#39;ve been writing a Drupal module to make it searchable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our next phone call will be Wednesday March 7 at 1:30 PM EST.</p>

<p>That is a well described notes. Especially to me it complements the parts of conversation I had to miss due to disturbance on line( or whatever). </p>
<p> I tried but failed to locate  your e-mail on the &#39;to&#39;  list of addresses on  mail sent by Aliya and thought of keeping this note here.  I guess most likely we will be discussing  PHP and Mysql.  </p>
<p>It  was nice being able to say hello on the conference call day.</p>
