<p>Last week I attended NTEN's 2007 <a href="http://nten.org/ntc">Nonprofit Technology Conference</a> and sat in on a wonderful session entitled <strong>Nonprofit Communications 2.0: Seven Steps to Transform Your Organization.</strong> Led by <a href="http://www.cctv.org/index.php?SiteAlias=cctv&amp;PageAlias=CCTV_Staff#LG">Lauren-Glenn Davitian</a> of the <a href="http://www.cctv.org/">CCTV Center for Media and Democracy</a>, the session provided a strong framework for nonprofits to better communicate in an increasingly networked society.</p>
<p><em>(crossposted from <a href="http://island94.org">my personal blog</a>)</em></p>
<p>I am also very lucky to serve with Lauren-Glenn on the  editorial board of the <a href="http://communitymediareview.org/">Community Media Review</a>.</p>
<p>The video itself is approximately 1 hour, 24 minutes long and worth every second, but I included my notes from the session below.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Community building talent is the single most important resource in the modern world.
</p></blockquote>
<div class="attribution">Peter Drucker</div>
<h3>How to engage and mobilize members</h3>
<p>A Communications framework for thinking about how organizational objectives are met through interaction.  The correlating Development framework is in parenthesis.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Welcome</strong> (Prospect)</li>
<li><strong>Educate</strong> (Cultivation)</li>
<li><strong>Ask</strong> (Involvement)</li>
<li><strong>Thank</strong> (Stewardship)</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Seven Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Assessment</strong>: Defining your goal (What behavior are you trying to change in undertaking a communications strategy?), audience (an explicit, targeted "who" and their values), evaluating your infrastructure (orthodoxies, structure, time, leadership)</li>
<li><strong>Awareness</strong>: Start by searching <a href="http://nten.org">NTEN</a>, <a href="http://techsoup.org">TechSoup</a>, <a href="http://www.idealware.org/">Idealware</a>, etc. (Link Research)</li>
<li><strong>Training</strong>: A discipline of doing things.  How are stories told, infrastructure built and actions communicated to regular people?</li>
<li><strong>Content Production</strong>: "The currency of the new world"</li>
<li><strong>Technical Support</strong>: An example: how to know when to build and when to buy</li>
<li><strong>Partnerships</strong>: Who is going to stand up for you?</li>
<li><strong>Planning</strong>: What are the components that revolve around your goal?</li>
</ol>

<p><em>I shot this video with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Casio-Exilim-EX-S600-Digital-Optical/dp/B000E158D4">Casio EX-S600</a>, which shoots full-frame (640 x 480) MPEG-4 video.  With a two gigabyte SD Card it can shoot approximately an hour and a half of video at medium quality before its battery dies.  The Casio's AVI wrapper is incompatible with iMovie (or any Quicktime decoder), so I first used <a href="http://www.techspansion.com/visualhub/">VisualHub</a> to repackage the video as an MP4 before importing into iMovie to add titles.  I exported from iMovie as DV and then converted that with VisualHub into MPEG-4.  Compressed and at quarter-frame (320 x 240) the entire video was 105 MB.  This time I uploaded to Google Video since <a href="http://blip.tv">Blip.tv</a> stalled out.</em></p>

	    <p>Windows users are probably on top of this, but as a Mac user typing a &cent; symbol in Windows (XP) had me baffled the other week. I made this quick list to help myself out next time:</p>
<p>in order to type the "cent" symbol under Windows, you have to either use the numeric keypad, open the character map, or add an "international" keyboard layout.</p>
<ul>
<li>numeric keypad: hold down Alt and type "0162"; it won't work if you type it on the numbers above the keyboard. A few more examples here: <a href="http://tlt.its.psu.edu/suggestions/international/accents/codealt.html">Windows Alt Key Numeric Codes</a>. You can find the alt key code for any character in Windows' Character Map.</li>
<li>character map: it's located in Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Character Map. click on the character you want, then hit the "select" button, then the "copy" button, then paste it into the place where you wanted it five minutes ago.</li>
<li><a href="http://depts.gallaudet.edu/forlang/Accented_Characters2004.html">adding an "international" keyboard layout</a>: gives Mac-like key combos to get tildes, etc. Doesn't seem like it's optimized for regular typing, though.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've since added your instructions as a reference... thanks!</p>

				<p class="MsoNormal">In the late 1970s and through all of the 1980s, unequal access to computers, the internet, and other forms of communication technology were seen as distant problems of a space-aged 21st century, if they were even thought of at all. In the 1980s and before, home computers were rare, expensive, and an esoteric pastime of enthusiasts. The internet was merely a pay-per-email facilitation device used by scholars and top government officials, and cordless phones were all the rage. The World Wide Web (WWW), multimedia computers, and fiber optic networks were all still under construction by computer technicians, engineers, and Al Gore. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was not until the High Performance Computing Act passed on December 9, 1991 that mass internet access in the United States became a possibility. Aimed at bolstering the economy of the coming millennia, this bill proposed the creation of a high speed fiber optic network or what was called the National Information Infrastructure (NII). The bill’s effect on internet access was enormous. In the Fall of 1990 there were approximately 313,000 computers online throughout the United States, and by 1996 that number exploded to 10 million (<span>Campbell-Kelly and Aspray 1996)</span>. Coupled with the introduction of the Mosaic web browser and the user-friendly Windows Operating System, fascination and wonder in the internet began to take off in American culture.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the latter half of the 1990s the internet phenomena captured the imagination of many. The internet was what the railroad, the automobile, and the telephone were in their respective eras. The internet was a revolution, and it was going to change the economy, communication, society, and create an ever-shrinking planet. The internet was thought to be so full of possibilities that anyone who was left out of the revolution was doomed to a life of unconnected alienation, missed opportunity, and information poverty, while those basking in the glow of a Yahoo! flashing computer screen were thought to be sophisticated, chic, and informed individuals making a prudent choice by getting connected. Nobody, it was thought, should be deprived of the internet, its alternative plane of existence (cyberspace), and the endless possibilities of its infinite human network.</p>
<p>As the internet’s mystique grew, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) disseminated a report in July 1995 called <em>Falling Through the Net: a Survey of the “Have Nots” in Rural and Urban </em><em>America</em>. Although not mentioning the exact phrase “digital divide”, this report found that poor people in general have the lowest penetration rates of NII, while those who were poor and actually had access to the internet in their homes were more likely to engage in “on-line services that facilitate economic uplift and empowerment” (<a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/" title="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/">http://www.ntia.doc.gov/</a> ntiahome/fallingthru.html). Assumed in the report was that the internet was a driver of empowerment and marker of equity. The hype behind the usefulness of internet was picking up steam.<br />
</p><p class="MsoNormal">Months after the NTIA’s initial report, the exact phrase “digital divide” began to surface along the American Psyche. According to chat room legend, Amy Harmon, a journalist at the Los Angeles Times, wrote a story in 1996 about a split between a husband and wife regarding the husband’s preoccupation with the internet. The wife, feeling ignored and unloved by her husband’s seemingly perpetual computer use, was threatening to leave him if he did not comply with her wishes. She described the rift between the husband and wife as a “digital divide”. Hence, the digital divide phrase became coined.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A short time later, Allen Hammond, a law professor at New York Law School, and Larry Irving, a political appointee at the Department of Commerce, began using the phrase “digital divide” much differently. Hammond and Irving used the phrase often in public speeches to describe a binary divide between the computer and internet haves and have nots. Much in the spirit of the NTIA’s initial <em>Falling Through the Net</em> report, Hammond and Irving pointed out that many classes of Americans such as women, African Americans, American Indians, low-income Americans, and the disabled all had disproportionately low computer and internet penetration rates compared to those who had computers and internet access in their homes. This marked the beginning of the current meaning of the phrase today.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By 1999 the phrase “digital divide” became a common slogan for policy makers, non-profit organizations, and others involved in the high-tech sector. Its simplistic and alliterative tone gave decision makers something to rally behind as the public still began to adapt to the lightning fast progress of information communication technology (ICT). During this time, while the internet became exceedingly ubiquitous and prevalent within American society, households with internet access were becoming the norm. Gaps in access to the internet remained along racial, income, and geographic lines; however the NTIA and others suffered from a serious lack of data and inadequately demonstrated their argument.</p>
<p>The NTIA’s first three <em>Falling Through the Net</em> reports of the 1990s really represented the government’s awakening to the ICT gap. Relying solely on Census data, the NTIA was only able to gather data on computer, telephone, and modem ownership, and did not account for other forms of internet access. Additionally, monitoring and demonstrating how the internet was actually used by the privileged and under-privileged was a near impossible task for the NTIA at the time. Focusing solely on ownership of ICT and ignoring how the technology was actually used prevented the NTIA and others from an in depth analysis of inequitable technology access (<a href="http://www7.nationalacademies" title="http://www7.nationalacademies">http://www7.nationalacademies</a>. org/cstb/wp_digitaldivide.pdf).<br />
</p><p class="MsoNormal">As more information became available, experts began to rethink the digital divide and expand it beyond the binary haves and have not concept. As early as 2000, right before the dot.com bubble burst, author Steve Cisler began questioning the preciseness of the digital divide slogan and reframed the issue of internet access. He and others felt the term was over-simplistic, demeaning, and took “on a very different caste in an international context where problems are so much greater than in the United States” (Cisler 2000). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He felt that the internet connection existed on a spectrum rather than a binary relationship. It was apparent to them that the line of thinking: “You are online or offline; you have a computer or you are without one; you are trained for the digital future, or you are in dead-end low paying work” was inconsistent with reality and condescending at the same time. He felt that people fall on a spectrum of connectivity where some benefit from high-speed access in their personal homes, others have slower cable-modem access, others have access in schools, libraries, or other public places, while others still choose not to be connected in the first place. Cisler reasoned that many people choose to be offline for many different reasons and to assume that someone remains offline is doomed to a life of hardship and disgrace is arrogant and techno-centric. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the year 2001 after the dot.com bubble burst and the initial enthusiasm of the digital age began to wane, computers and the internet started to reach the majority, while their cost became cheaper and their ease of operation improved. As ICT became more commonplace, many observers believed that the digital divide had been exaggerated or would eventually be closed due to a Reaganesque trickle down principle. By 2004, the NTIA’s <em>A Nation Online: Entering the Broadband Age</em> report highlighted the growth of ICT access and just fell short of declaring the issue of the digital divide closed. Michael Powell, then chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), mocked the digital divide issue by declaring, “I think there is a Mercedes-Benz divide, I’d like one, but I can’t afford it” (<a href="http://www.consumerfed.org/pdfs/digitaldivide.pdf" title="http://www.consumerfed.org/pdfs/digitaldivide.pdf">http://www.consumerfed.org/pdfs/digitaldivide.pdf</a>). The digital divide, for so long perceived as that binary divide between the ICT haves and have nots, was losing its spot on America’s agenda, while the true victims of the digital divide remained unattended to due to the belief that the market would work its magic and fix the problem on its own.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In response to the NTIA’s new stance on the digital divide, many authors took up the challenge to reopen the debate by reframing the issue and picked up where Steve Cisler and others left off. Currently, many authors recognize that ICT does in fact play a critical role in the American economy and society, and that access to ICT plays a part in determining marginalization and inclusion in society. However, with a critical eye on the initial excitement and exuberance over the internet phenomenon, they are quick to point out that technological gadgets are merely a means to social connectedness rather than the solution to all the problems of the under-privileged. Furthermore, these authors place heavier emphasis on <span>social inequality rather than pure technological inequality; emphasis on access to public resources over access to computers; and overall skills and abilities rather than just computer skills. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Some have even considered dropping the term altogether. Bill Callahan, a community organize in </span><span>Cleveland</span><span> has argues the term digital divide “is too constructed, too alliterative, too Al Gore; eventually we’re going to need a pithier, more evocative, more specific name for the thing we’re fighting” (Cisler 2000). Accordingly, others do offer alternative catch phrases, such as ‘Technology and Social Inclusion’ and ‘the deepening divide’ (Warschauer 2003 and Van Dijk 2005). Irregardless of what you call it, the problems of under-privileged receiving inadequate computer training, improving social services for the under-privileged through technology, and improving ICT access throughout the nation remain to this day.</span> </p>

				<p>I arrived home on Saturday after being away at the NTEN Conference in Washington, DC. It was a very good experience. I learned a lot there, but tjoday I have been catching up on what&#39;s occured here since I&#39;ve been away.</p>
<p>It was nice seeing familiar faces again. I also am interested in forming an advisory council of adult learners and volunteers, etc., to get more information/suggestions/ideas as to how to improve our Computer Technology Learning Center (CTLC). If anyone has suggestions or ideas, or can put me in touch with someone who does, please let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Well, I just wanted to check-in. I&#39;m still at work and will write more later. </p>

	    <p>Hey Julia,</p>
<p>It was great to see you too, even if we didn't get to catch up much with me running around so much to advocate for the Project!</p>

<p>If you're looking to get some advice on how to incorporate more input on your program from it's users and volunteers I'd recommend connecting with two org's with VISTAs - UTEC in Lowell and HPP out in CA.  <a href="http://ctcvista.org/user/797">Jeff Blakely</a> and previous VISTAs at <a href="http://www.utec-lowell.org/">UTEC</a> have a great model for having youth make decisions and actions for the organization.  And <a href="http://ctcvista.org/blog/962">Brittney Fosbrook</a> at <a href="http://www.homelessprenatal.org/">Homeless Prenatal Program</a> is working with some similar populations as you and their tech center is almost fully run by volunteers!</p>

	    <p>It was an excellent conference for CTC VISTAs, lots of good energy all around, and with the VISTAs there especially. VISTAs were treated very well — lots of free drink tickets, and admission to the parties (which was good sense of the party organizers&#39; parts since VISTAs were the life of them). Between our workshops, session at the Science Fair, being a recipient of Grassroots.org&#39;s &quot;Techie&quot; award, our new posters, as well as having a good contigency, we had an excellent presence.

				<p>As my subject says I&#39;m trying to stay up with this. I have been doing more with the Gateway project now that I&#39;m free from the front desk and able to set up more meetings. The tax site is going well and we are almost done with our first year. We have helped many clients with tax prepoation and so far none have come back incorrect. Wheeeew. Still keeping up with the online stuff, added some new links to trackstar.4teachers.org  so if you want to check it out feel free. Thats it for now and I will see you at the area meeting.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ctcvistaqueen/443671270/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/181/443671270_31dd377853_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="Alana, PTD Media Watch Team member (close)" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" /></a>I'm here at MIT (my fall place of graduate <a href="http://dusp.mit.edu/">Urban Planning studies</a>, btw) at the <a href="http://www.centerfornewwords.org/wam/">2007 Women Action and Media (WAM!) conference</a> this weekend, a yearly conference that combines a bunch of topics that interest me - media, activism, social justice, and women's issues.  I read BITCHfest for my book club recently (selections from BITCH magazine), and it got me more interested in feminist media related issues, especially in that the techniques and lessons learned by  feminist activists around framing in the media relates to many other issues (such as poverty, network neutrality, and more).</p>
<p>So far, I've gone to three very different sessions.  The first pre-conference session attracted me around the idea of <strong>framing class more effectively in the media</strong>.  [I mean, come on, we're VISTAs fighting poverty, right?]  Ellen Bravo (and her book, Taking on the Big Boys) suggested a few interesting hooks to change the way the mainstream media frames issues of class and work:</p>
<p><strong>The Snow Day</strong> - The kids don't have to go to school, but many low-income parents do; that means that a snow day really means a day home alone for many youth.</p>
<p><strong>The Flu Epidemic</strong> - The media is always covering stories about people not staying home to stop the spread of the flu virus.  But if you really think about it, people with low paying and/or part-time jobs can't afford to take sick days and they usually have service jobs like cleaning public spaces or handling food.</p>
<p><strong>"Best places to work" lists</strong> - We need to probe more about these lists, because the companies on the list often give money to associations that give awards.  </p>
<p>I went from thinking about poverty's media image, to the image of social change on the web.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Momentum-Igniting-Social-Change-Connected/dp/0787984442">Allison Fine, and her book Momentum: Igniting Social Change in the Connected Age</a>, has been getting a bit of buzz at Project HQ because it's basically what the CTC VISTA Project is trying to do only a daily VISTA basis.  Mostly the session fueled more questions than answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>? Is MoveOn.org really just a reflection class organizing techniques?<br />
We need to tap into the core fundamental ways of behaving by successful social change organizations and how they convey to using new media/tech. Primarily, we should focus on how to start and facilitate conversations to build a movement.  You can start with an online conversation but they can be better implemented combined with in-person discussions.</li>
<li>? Why are there no comments on our organizations blog?<br />
There was a frustration around not getting any interactions on blogs and listservs, because they get put out there and they don't get used.  This can be combatted through connecting these conversations to in-person interactions and by also participating in other nonprofit's online networks.</li>
<li>? Are we blogging/podcasting just because it's cool?<br />
The challenge is that there is an array of tools to have two-way interactions but are non-profits really taking advantage of that? Are they really offering up space to comment, but they don't respond (listening deficits)...behaving still one-to-many communication scheme?</li>
<li>? Are we liable for things said in blogs/forums on a site if we host it on our server? Many participants were afraid of not having enough control of the message if the movement building happens in an online social network.</li>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ctcvistaqueen/443671266/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/201/443671266_4e2f25f04d_m.jpg" width="184" height="240" alt="Alana, PTD Media Watch Team member" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></a>On Saturday, I became "press", helping Alana, a very capable young woman of the <a href="http://www.projectthinkdifferent.org/index.htm">Project Think Different Media Watch Team</a>, video several sessions over the course of the day.</p>
<p>In the Our 21st Century Bodies, Our Multimedia Selves session, the presenters spoke about how their transporting information dissemination from a published book (Our Bodies, Our Selves) to online (<a href="http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org" title="http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org">http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org</a>).  I liked how Elana Hayasaka simplified how new online media are taking advantage of the weaknesses of classic print media for activism:</p>
<p>- update quicker and more often<br />
- more accessibility / web search function<br />
- avoid cost page limits<br />
- dispersal to a wider audience<br />
- involve the reader (interactivity)<br />
- appeal to younger readership</p>
<p>Yet again, the topic of the "freedom" of blogging versus having a moderation scheme came up.  But I like that they admit that the focus of the blogs shouldn't just be just a public relations tool for the organization, but instead give a framework (social, political) for further discussions of women's health.  I also really like one example blog they referenced <a href="http://hollabackboston.blogspot.com/">Hollaback Blogs</a>, that encourages people to blog a photo/video (from your camera phone) of a person that sexually harass them on the street. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.protectchoice.org/RECOGNIZEcampaign/recognize_tn.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />  "For some fun, go listen to the <a href="http://www.helpingourteengirls.org/programs/girlscouncil.htm">HOTGirls</a> (Helping Our Teen Girl in Real Life Situations) version of <a href="http://www.helpingourteengirls.org/media/hotgirlssexyback.mp3">JT's "Sexy Back."</a>  It's a good way to start thinking about framing media for young women of color (YWOC), as demonstrated by this project out of Atlanta, GA.  I was really impressed by the materials from the presenters in this workshop, from the <a href="http://leadershipforchange.org/">Advocacy Institute</a> - they have some great handouts on <a href="http://www.advocacy.org/communicate/">Designing Effective Outreach Strategies</a>.  More so, I was impressed by the media examples from the <a href="http://www.protectchoice.org/index.htm">Pro-Choice Public Education Project (PEP)</a> <a href="http://www.protectchoice.org/RECOGNIZEcampaign/index2.htm">Recognize</a> campaign.  Most interestingly, both HOTGirls and PEP have campaigns/programs fueled by <a href="http://www.protectchoice.org/who_we_are_ywlc.htm">youth leadership councils</a> and did extensive research ahead of time on tailoring the message effectively for YWOC.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ctcvistaqueen/443671278/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/170/443671278_dd329c45ba_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Effective Messaging for Young Women of Color" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></a>[Download the powerpoint from the Do You Know Who You’re Talking To?: Effective Messaging for Young Women of Color, with Nicole Clark, Candace Webb session <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/~danielle/WAM_ywoc.pdf">here</a>.]</p>
<p>Finally, I ended the day in the "On the front-lines of Media Justice: Transitions in Policy and Movement Building" - which really meant: how do we change gears in a social change organization without causing a crash.  Hannah Sassman presented a great case study of how <a href="http://www.prometheusradio.org/">Prometheus Radio Project</a> decided if they were going to expand their community radio efforts into community wireless efforts.  They made the hard decision to not go with the community wireless buzz because it didn't fully serve their constituents.<br />
"We made the decision to put off expanding into wireless advocacy efforts until when the time was right, not when the time was sexy." Sari Gelzer also alluded to the decision making process of the <a href="http://www.global-action.org/main.html">Global Action Project</a> to update their efforts to train youth-led organizations in media skills, in an environment where the part-time implementors of programs in non-profits didn't necessarily have time and/or opportunity to participate in decision-making. </p>
<p>[We had a great discussion on some specific examples of how non-profits approach transitions and sustainability, but I had videotape the session so I'm hoping Hannah posts the notes soon on her blog <a href="http://hannahjs.worpress.com/">http://hannahjs.worpress.com</a>.]</p>
<p>On that note, I'm pooped.  I'm off.</p>

The program is called <strong>Spreading the Stories</strong>  (sponsored by <a href="http://www.massimpact.org">MassIMPACT</a>) and it&#39;s a 3 full day hands-on workshop where you&#39;ll create a digital story and discuss how to implement it in your own organizations. <strong>The workshop will be held at the <a href="http://www.bcnc.net">Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center</a> on May 1, 8, &amp; 9th from 9-5pm (with an orientation on Friday April 27th from 10-12noon).</strong>     </p>
<p>Digital stories are a tremendous resource for community-based organizations. Most community efforts use stories to build relationships, to connect with others, and to advocate for themselves. Often, those who are effecting change on the ground lack knowledge of basic media skills that can capture and represent the images and voices behind these stories.</p>
<p>    Spreading the Stories is a four-day intensive professional development workshop, where participants create digital stories -- brief multimedia narratives combining voice, imagery and video. Through the creation of digital stories, organizations can reflect upon, learn from, document, and share stories that emerge through their practice. The workshop is free, and is intended as both a production and a train-the-trainer event, where participants leave with their own digital stories and the skills necessary to teach others the process.      </p>
<p>To expand the reach of digital storytelling, MassIMPACT, along with <a href="http://www.creativenarrations.net">Creative Narrations</a>, launched Spreading the Stories in the fall of 2005.  Twelve organizations’ staff from the Boston area was trained in 2005-6, and many of these organizations have since used digital storytelling to self-produce promotional materials, enhance programming, and secure grant funding.  In addition to gaining practical skills, participants found inspiration in the creative process and unique networking opportunities among the participating organizations.    </p>
<p>In this next phase of the program, MassIMPACT intends to focus workshops on new communities, including (but not limited to) Asian, Latino, Cape Verdean, &amp; Haitian groups and others in Western Massachusetts.  In coalition with Inquilinos Boricuas en Accion (IBA) and Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center, the workshop in March 2007 focused on incorporating digital storytelling into community programs in the South End to foster partnerships and inter-organizational programs and events.    </p>
<p><strong>The workshop is FREE for selected organizations, contingent that you vow to go back to your organizations and share 3 stories you help create over the next year.  You can down the <a href="//www.ctcvista.org/files/digstory_appl_07_bcnc2.doc<br />
">application here</a> or on the MassIMPACT website <a href="http://www.massimpact.org/projects/digital_storytelling/spreading_stories.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.massimpact.org/projects/digital_storytelling/spreading_stories.shtml</a> , due by April 17th.</strong>  </p>

				<p>I almost forgot! </p>
<p>Andrew Lynn, who is spearheading the NYMAP/YVXN thingamajig flew to Portland last week for a visit.  </p>
<p>For those of you who aren&#39;t &quot;in the know&quot;, NYMAP stand for the National Youth Media Access Project.  I guess somebody didn&#39;t like the acronym though, because now I think it is being changed to YVXN, which stands for Youth Video eXchange Network.  The idea is that cable access centers around the country will be able to digitally swap youth-produced videos.  So far, it is still in the testing stages, with only a handful of access centers being involved, but the hopes are to eventually include many more.  </p>
<p>Anyway, things are going really well for the <a href="http://www.nymapexchange.net/" title="YVXN">YVXN</a>.  In the few months that it&#39;s been going on, YVXN has already amassed a bazillion hours of youth-produced video.  You can&#39;t actually watch any of it at this point, but you can at least read <a href="http://www.nymapexchange.net/allvideos" title="all videos">descriptions</a> of all the cool content that is being shared.</p>
<p>There are still a few kinks to work out, especially relating to the many different playback systems that are being used across the country (VHS, D9, digital Mpeg-2, DVD, etc.), but we are getting there.  The end. </p>

				<p>Hey everybody!  Long time, no blog.</p>
<p>Things have been crazy around here as of late, but now that it is spring break, I have one week without OLLIE gigs to catch up on everything that I have been neglecting.  That means four short movies to edit, some DVDs to create, and a website to build.  We&#39;ll see how much I actually get done.</p>
<p> In other news, I managed to put together another Kirsten Academy class (after nearly 3 months without one).  The topic this time was stop-motion animation!  Check out the movies we made <a href="http://www.kirstenacademy.blogspot.com" title="Kirsten Academy">here</a>.  We used a program called <a href="http://www.istopmotion.com/" title="iStopMotion">iStopMotion</a>, which can be purchased online for about $40.  Recently, however, I was talking with Andrew of YVXN/NYMAP fame, and he recommended a program called <a href="http://framethief.com/" title="FrameThief">FrameThief</a>, which is actually free!  </p>
<p>So if any of you want to make some stop-motion movies as well, download FrameThief, find yourself a digital camcorder and a firewire cable, and get to it.  It&#39;s as easy as that.   If you watch all 5 of our movies (which are all very short), you can see that we used a variety of materials; construction paper, magazines, clay, coloring books, buttons, etc.  It was really easy and lots of fun.  In fact, there have been requests for an encore lesson.  If I ever get around to teaching a second class, I&#39;ll try to put together a tutorial video as well, so that all of you can see how easy it is to make your own animation.  </p>
<p>After which, I might declare a cross-country CTC VISTA supershort animation contest!  Anybody interested? </p>

	    <p>Hey Gariet,</p>
<p>Good to hear you're getting a breather.</p>
<p>Did you catch the stop motion animation we made with the new CTC VISTA mascot, the robot at a MA area meeting a couple months ago? (Did you get yours?) Julie edited it and <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7938493056284893419&amp;hl=en">posted it on her blog</a>.</p>
<p>I'm SO in for a robot inspired animation show-off!</p>

	    <p>I can&#39;t believe how many robots you have!  This is just like when I was a kid, and I could only afford 1 stormtrooper figure.  And my friend Matt had a whole army of them!  I want more robots!!!</p>
<p> And yeah, I got the robot.  And it arrived on my birthday, so that was pretty sweet.  I thought it was  a birthday robot at first, actually.  But I guess everybody got them.   </p>

			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p> Another recent  project has been automating the firmware upgrade process on CUWiN nodes.  To accomplish this I&#39;ve hooked into the upgrade script present on each node.  I&#39;ve added a script to be on each node that functions in one of two ways: 1) automatically checks for updates and runs the update process, scheduled through cron and 2) a remote &quot;head&quot; initiates the process and tells a set of nodes to check for updates and perform the upgrade if necessary.  The nodes query a webserver for a list of updates.  The webserver contains a list of id&#39;s and version numbers for those id&#39;s.  A node retrieves this list, finds its id (not necessarily unique), and compares its version number to the one listed.  If the one listed is newer, it dowloads the file specified and runs the upgrade.  Once the upgrade is complete, the node reboots (if run directly), or schedules a reboot for a random time in the future (automatic mode).</p>
<p> This functionality, while still in its early stages greatly simplifies network managment and maintainence tasks.  Previously, one would have to connect to each node individually to perform the upgrade.  In a local network of over 40 nodes, this takes considerable time. </p>

				<p>I recently started on a new project to improve the ease of use of the CUWiN network system.  The project is a web application (PHP based) to allow communities and other collaborative entities to create and manage custom firmware images for their wireless nodes.  The first is finished but not live.  It addresses the issue of needed secure passwords node shell users (those with access to the actually OS prompt, i.e. root).  We have a password database we use internally on the network here in C-U, however we don&#39;t distribute that for obvious reasons.  The precompiled images we provided have a very unsecure and published default password.  While it is possible to change this password from the console, this is inefficient in a large network and changes such as this do not generally persist across equipment reboots.  This application addresses this gap by allowing the user to securely manage a list of users and passwords through the web.  This information is stored in their own password database.  The next phase of the application will integrate with the firmware build system.  Partially compiled firmware will be available to the web application, which can then, at the users request, complete a build of the software, including their custom user/password database, and then provide then a secure link to download the file.  Features to be added are the ability to customize the main configuration file (which controls how all the network interfaces are configured, the wireless settings, etc), and the ability to select hardware type and disk geometry.  This application will go a long way to increase the ease of use of the technology.</p>
