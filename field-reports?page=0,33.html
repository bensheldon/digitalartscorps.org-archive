<p>--------------------------- </p>
<p><span>ka-BLOG! We want to take over the blogosphere for 16 days.</span></p>
<p><span>ka-BLOG! is a 16-day blog fest for the Take Back the Tech Campaign. It is open to anyone and everyone - girls, boys, everyone beyond and more -- who wants to share their thoughts, write poetry and prose, post graphics / pictures, rant, rave, heckle, make snide remarks, stick their tongue out at violence against women, and how online communications can exacerbate or help eliminate VAW.</span></p>
<p><span> ---------------------------</span></p>
<p><span>What is the campaign about?</span></p>
<p><span>---------------------------</span></p>
<p><span>It is simply a call for every person– women and men, who uses online communications (ICTs), e.g. for chatting, emailing, blogging, doing websites or developing tools, to use ICTs for activism against VAW (violence against women) for 16 days. Primarily, we are asking women and grrls to “Take Back The Tech!” But you don’t have to be female to disagree with violence faced by women and be part of the campaign to transform gender relations. Unequal power relations lie at the heart of VAW, and this is apparent from the streets to online spaces. So we are saying technology should be used for equality, not to perpetuate violence.</span></p>
<p><span>---------------</span></p>
<p><span>How to ka-BLOG?</span></p>
<p><span>---------------</span></p>
<p><span>1. *commit*: commit yourself to 16 days of blogging about violence against women and technology. </span></p>

Email us, and we&#39;ll send you links on how to start your own blog :)</span></p>
<p><span>3. *identify*: make it known by putting a takebackthetech icon on your blog — create your own or grab a few icons from our Campaign Tools and Materials.</span></p>
<p><span>4. *post*: post something about the how you think violence against women connects with information communications technology? have a story? heard something quirky? snap a picture? think this is serious? doesn&#39;t make much sense? anything at all! just post one thing a day from 25 nov to 10 dec on thinking about violence against women</span></p>
<p><span>5. tag it: use &quot;takebackthetech&quot; to tag your posts (<a href="http://www.takebackthetech.net/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=blogathon#tag" target="_blank">http://www.takebackthetech.net/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=blogathon#tag</a>)</span></p>
<p><span>6. link back: send in your bloglinks and and we&#39;ll rss your posts to the campaign website throughout the 16 day</span></p>
<p><span>7. expand: widen the campaign to your readers by linking your blog to the campaign site . </span></p>
<p><span>-----------------------</span></p>
<p><span>What to ka-BLOG! About?</span></p>
<p><span>-----------------------</span></p>
<p><span>So long as it&#39;s about violence against women (well, against) and how it connects to ICTs (and vice versa). So long as it&#39;s about gender relations. So long as it&#39;s about how women can have more control over technology. So long as it&#39;s about women and gender equality.</span></p>
<p><span>It does not matter to us if the blog entries come in the form of jokes, limmericks, poetry, short stories, blurbs, graphics, pictures, articles, creative narratives.</span></p>

				<p>I have been wanting to say something about making it on low income. </p>
<p>One, I don&#39;t have any secret to doing so. But I aught to, I suppose.</p>
<p>I think I&#39;m a bit different. A lot VISTA talk was about sacrificing by making such a low income for a year. I get the impression that for a lot of you, this is a big change. I, on the other hand, have hardly ever made more than I&#39;m making now. And in fact, had been unemployed since June when I started my service in September.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever cracked $15,000 for a year. The amount I&#39;ll be making from the living allowence is much more typical. And I&#39;ve made less.</p>
<p>So, I aught to have great advice. But I don&#39;t I have horrible credit and I&#39;ve been to a doctor once since my dad&#39;s insurance stopped covering me when I was 19 (I&#39;m 36 now). Hmm. I can say this, I don&#39;t trust credit cards or checking accounts. Something always gets messed up. And don&#39;t live off your student loans. That was a bad idea.</p>
<p>This is the poverty level, but I still go out. I see movies. I hang out with friends, eat dinner (or lunch) out occaisionally. Take my ex-girlfriend&#39;s kids to eat or to a movie. I&#39;d date, but I don&#39;t know how to tell what&#39;s a date and what&#39;s hanging out. I live like I always have, with bills hovering, a car that has problems, and lots of stress.  </p>
<p>It&#39;s not easy, but with the health benefits (I&#39;ve foresworn the Seven Corners for an MI Health Card) it&#39;s actually an improvement. The fact that I&#39;m doing something I enjoy for a change is amazing. And once this yeat is out I hope that my experience will translate into a job that I enjoy and gets me above the poverty level for a change.</p>
<p>I hope every one is doing well on their low incomes. I had a bit of freak out session with my car tire going flat twice and the door refusing to shut, but I&#39;m doing okay now. I got a used tire for $25 and I just have to remember not to open my driver&#39;s side door. :D</p>
<p> Take Care,</p>
<p>Rich </p>

				<p><strong>This is an excellent example of how to network on the web.  I have been a member of a motorcycle forum for over 2 year...maybe three.  Anyways I went to visit a fellow member this last weekend and this is the story that I posted on my forum.  It has pictures. :)</strong> </p>
<p>Well this was a great weekend. I have got to admit that its some of the best riding I have done. So I will do my best to explain it. Patti can jump in and fill in any details that I failed with.</p>
<p>Friday night my roommates drug me out to the bar so I was up to about 3 am. I was so worried that I wasn&#39;t going to make it up to Sedona the next day. I was the designated driver so I had to be responsible (as much as that stinks). Anyways I didn&#39;t want to feel iffy in the morning. I was up early. Had a gut full of coffee and I was off and away from the apartment at 7:50 out of the rat race zone.</p>
<p>Out onto the 202 and swinging around onto the 101 loop around the east side of Phoenix. I thought I had left early enough for the crazies to still be in bed. Ya right. 100 mph on the interstate seems excessive...but not for these people. Thank goodness no one was trying to share my lane today. </p>
<p>I swing off the 101 loop onto I-17 north. The road is quiet and only 4 lane. Its amazing to watch the terrain change as you head farther north. The desert plants give way to scrub trees as you head into the higher elevations. This is where I started to get a bit of bite from the wind.(stick a sock in it Brad!!!!) This is also the area where I start thinking that my 120 mile range isn&#39;t enough. (stupid small tank) Stop for a quick fill up(3 bucks a gallon...) and I am back on the road with 30 miles left. This is where the elevation starts changing greatly. Up and down and some amazing views. Then my exit is upon me. Off the road and only about a quarter mile to Dave&#39;s shop. Over the cattle guard and just off to the right. I got to admit I find the cattle guards unnerving. I have never been comfortable driving over something that is steel. </p>
<p>I pull into Dave&#39;s shop and I can see Pmint out front waving me in. Am I that obvious. LOL. Anyways. I am all jacking into my tunes and my stocking cap on under my helmet. So whatever she said when I shut the bike off never got to me. She gave me a huge hug...and let me get situated. Small chit chat and meeting the big guy (Dave). She wasn&#39;t lying. Thats for darn sure. I have a short chat and then Patti tells me we have to go on a parts run. This is starting to feel more and more like home. I got a first class ride in the Dodge and a chance to thaw. I hope I get the details right but I believe we went to Cottonwood or was it Cornville. Great ride...even if it was in a cage. I was trying to soak up this absolutely gorgeous area. Right now they are having their fall leaves...if you can have that in Arizona. I got a great tour.</p>
<p>Got our parts and headed back to Dave&#39;s. Hmm I can&#39;t remember the route we took. Ha we took so many different roads I can&#39;t remember. We dropped the part off and I got to run over and check out Patti&#39;s home. I know some of you mentioned that Patti was great but I do not think you can really tell how much of a sweetheart she is until you meet her. Food and a nap and I was ready for a ride. </p>
<p>This is were the rocket ride gets pulled out. Patti&#39;s bike is a beast. Hearing that thing fire up and rumble was great. I then fire up the lowly 800 with it&#39;s quiet demeanor and off we go to pick up Dave. Patti had some race fuel in the bike and it was a sweet smell. There is nothing like the smell of burnt race fuel. </p>
<p>Pick up the big guy with his gold wing and we were off on the interstate. This is the point where I realize that I have no chance keeping up with Patti and it was going to be a long day if this was the pace we were going to go at!  She was just opening up on the interstate she said or &quot;blowing out the carbon&quot;. She let Dave and I catch up and by that time we were at our exit. We get off the interstate and somehow lost Dave. We got off the ramp and pulled over to the side of the road. This is where Patti mumbled something about a Wing being like Harley...but thats just what I heard...could have been something totally different.</p>
<p>We are off the interstate and heading towards Sedona. The traffic was horrible so we spin around and take a detour through Cottonville. Which was a great ride in itself. I do not remember the name of the road but 35 to 45 mph curves. I think I enjoy the low speed curves more then something like going 75 mph in a long sweeper. This road took us to a rest stop just outside of Sedona. I took a couple of pictures of all the bikes and got some good photos of Sedona off in the distance. We hope back on the road and in no time we are in Sedona. Sedona is beautiful but is it ever crowded! Overrun with tourists. I will have to return again but on a weekday. It took awhile to get through the stop and go traffic but onward to ride up Oak Creek Canyon. </p>
<p>This ride was great. It started out with some 45 to 55 mph curves. By the time we were getting to the top we were into the 15 mph hairpins. The whole time we were following Oak Creek and this was great area. Lots of aspens and tall pines along the ride. I wish there was less traffic to take some of the corners at some higher speeds but thats fine we still had a blast. I have to admit. I have done some super rides in Wisconsin. The Mindoro cut being the closest to this but the Mindoro cut is tiny compared to riding up this mountain. I would have to say this is one of the greatest rides I have taken for scenery and the technical riding. We stopped at a scenic overlook and took some pictures and froze in the high winds. I can&#39;t remember the exact elevation but I think it was just under 8000 feet. Lots of bite in the air now. Best part of all is that we get to head back down!</p>
<p>Thank goodness they didn&#39;t let me take the lead. I might have done something rash. Anyways back down the mountain and back through Slowdona. I think the traffic had Patti fired up a bit because she popped the clutch and revved the engine (using alot of fuel) at some guy that tried to pull out in front of us. I am not sure how he could miss us coming?? Wait silly question. </p>
<p>We made it out onto the interstate and heading back towards Patti&#39;s house. I am tailing the group just hanging out when I see Patti ride up beside Dave in the passing lane and she started to make a bunch of motions. I remember she mentioned her clutch was getting hot in Sedona so I thought she was saying that her clutch was slipping. We continue on and about another 5-10 minutes down the road Patti suddenly wants to get over. I was thinking that we were going to have to trailer the bike home cause her clutch burned up or something. Turns out someone&#39;s bike ran out of fuel...but I am not sure who&#39;s bike and who&#39;s fault it was.  I guess the race fuel burns faster. A short shot down the road and a 1.25 gallon gas can (whatever happened to simple 1 or 2 gallon gas cans) and back to the point of interest to fuel the unsaid bike. We were back on our way to Patti&#39;s house. </p>
<p>I will skip ahead and say that we went out for chinese. I swear....I think I gained 10 pounds this weekend. Patti knows how to feed a guy! </p>
<p>Here are the pics that I have...Patti has the others but because of technical difficulties we will have to get those later.<br /><a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2036355&amp;l=2ceef&amp;id=185101191" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/album.php?ai...f&amp;id=185101191</a></p>

				<p>hello from san francisco.  </p>
<p> it has been almost 3 weeks since my boss left and there is still no permanent new hire in sight.  currently, my ex-boss&#39;s niece is filling her position but i think it is only until the end of the year.  it is strange to automatically fill such a huge role in the organization.  i am now teaching a technology class to the community health workers on staff and going full speed ahead on website reworking.  everything is finally settling back down and the only huge obstacle is my lack of proficiency in spanish.  when i am the only person in the lab (which does happen often now) and a spanish speaker comes in i feel so useless.  my spanish skills, however, are rapidly improving.  </p>
<p> it turns out that there is a free &quot;website makeover&quot; happening this weekend that i was invited to.  a bunch of drupal experts will be there to help orgs convert their websites over to drupal.  this is really exciting to me because i have felt less confident doing it on my own.  </p>
<p> also, i attended the sf wifi conference last friday and met a new ctc vista named <a href="http://www.nten.org/staff" target="_blank">karl hedstrom</a> at nten.  although i thought the conference was a bit of a bust, i did link up with the <a href="http://www.bavc.org">bay area video coalition</a> (amazing organization), see <a href="http://www.aspirationtech.org/blog/heather">heather</a> from aspiration tech and a network with couple of other new bay area non-profit technology people.  </p>
<p> to top it all off, fellow ctc vista rebecca white and i ate some amazing vegan japanese food in the mission on monday night.  although it was pouring down rain, the hot soup and tea totally made my night. </p>

	    <p>Sounds like you are having a good time, for the most part.  I wish I was meeting more people, and going to conferences and things like that.  I can do without the vegan japanese food though.</p>
<p> Also...your bay area video coalition link is bad (it is missing the &quot;http:/&quot;).  You should fix the link so that I can see what is so amazing about them (because I&#39;m too lazy to type the url in myself). </p>

				<p>Last week my schedule changed from Mon-Fri to Tues-Sat.  Yesterday was my first Monday off, so today really feels like Monday.   Aside from that, it&#39;s not so bad.   Saturdays around Media Bridges is rather slow.  But the whole point for my move is to start a weekly Saturday program for youth around here.  </p>
<p>I&#39;m aiming to start it right after Thanksgiving.  Every Saturday for a couple of hours we will designate computers and space specfically for youth to come in and learn and work on projects.   The structure has not been completely set up yet, but I am planning on having weekly &#39;demos&#39; or mini-lessons.  This way a participant does not have to come in every week where one lesson builds on the previous one.  So one day will be intro to imovie and another day will be interviewing techniques and so on.  Then whenever a participant is ready to take a certification test, they can take it anytime and come in anytime during the week and use our equipment and edit stations.  We&#39;re all also thinking that the participants may have to submit a statement of purpose (or a video blog) about why they want to learn whatever or what project they want to do.  This will hopefully prevent kids from just coming in and using the internet or as an easy place for parents to drop off their kids for a few hours.  </p>
<p> This is a pilot program for a couple of months.   Originally, we were going to have afterschool workshops here, but we do not have any space at our facility during the aftershool hours (Media Bridges has to provide general classes to the public during those hours as part of our contract).  The two alternatives are Saturday programs here and going to do outreaches at afterschool programs.   I&quot;m contacting area afterschool programs to see what we can get going at their places rather than at Media Bridges.  There are some obstacles for that, but we&#39;re working on them.   </p>
<p>So all is moving along. </p>
<p> In other news, we&#39;ll be going up to Lansing, MI on Thursday for the <a href="http://www.csregionacm.org/" target="_blank">Alliance for Community Media, Central States</a> Conference and the Philo Awards.   I hear that public access people like to party.  I&#39;ll report back on that next week.   </p>

				<p>Good Morning, </p>
<p>Well, the sun is rising here in Michigan on chilly Friday. My computer is now by the window, so I can look out on the sky, the trees, the road, and the apartment complex office.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jeanne, my supervisor, said, &quot;It&#39;s the last good day for a bike ride.&quot; She was probably right. It was unusually nice yesterday and it&#39;s supposed to get colder starting today. But you never know. There could always be a 60 degree day in December. This is Michigan, after all.</p>
<p>Work has been keeping me pretty busy, the last couple weeks. MoLLIE was out at a school nearly every day for two weeks. Now we&#39;re settling back into a lighter schedule. And I really want to focus on developing an audio class. We don&#39;t have surveys in yet telling us that that is specifically what the community wants, but I&#39;m starting to think I should just proceed as if we have.  Not having the survey&#39;s is just a way of procrastinating on doing something that I&#39;ve never done, and thus is scary.</p>
<p>So, I&#39;m going to go over my syllabi (syllabuses?) from my audio production class at Grand Valley and think about what would work for a beginning and advanced class. Seems like a good starting point.</p>
<p>In life news; I got a car. I&#39;ve been without a car since July. And it really is no good in Grand Rapids. The public transit has improved over the years, but it&#39;s still not great for much besides going to and from work, and even then only if you are on a bus route (which fortunately I was). </p>
<p>Having a car means I can go out some nights. Especially nights when there are open mics for me to go and play my guitar and sing some songs. </p>
<p>My roommate and I are finally having a &quot;house&quot;-warming party. Which also doubles as a post Halloween, post-election celebration. And it&#39;s seems to have a six degrees of seperation aspect as well. If any VISTA&#39;s are in GR on Saturday, let me know, I&#39;ll give you directions. </p>
<p>Well, I&#39;m probably already going a bit long for a blog. So I think I&#39;ll say adu.</p>
<p>Peace,</p>
<p>Rich </p>

				<p>Last Friday, November 3rd, 2006, the Technical Assistance for Nonprofits group (aka TANs - technical <em>assistants</em> for nonprofits...at least in my book) had a conference call to make sure that everyone was still alive and kicking and doing well with their projects.  Although Kamala was out sick (hope you&#39;re feeling better!!), and John was....well, honestly I don&#39;t know (hmmm)...at least, I don&#39;t think he was there, but it can be hard to tell over the phone (sorry John if you were actually on the call!), the rest of us spoke for about an hour about VISTA life, our terms of service, and whatever else came to mind.  Below are some of the results:</p>
<p><strong>In The Future...</strong></p>
<p>For future calls, one member of the group is going to lead a discussion on a certain topic as to expand everyone else&#39;s knowledge on that particular topic.  For example, Tim will begin our next call leading us in a discussion about collaboration software tools.  All you other TANs be thinking about what you want to do for calls next year!</p>
<p><strong>Project Updates</strong></p>
<p>Cheryl has been heading up workshops, doing web modificiations, meeting with agencies to address how their needs can be met, and a number of other things.  Yay Cheryl!</p>
<p>Laura (yes, me) has been focusing on checking one of the web-based tools Pangea uses for data management for inconsistencies.  In addition, she has been updating a training manual for one of their other systems since it was out-of-date.  Good thing she loves detail-oriented work!</p>
<p>Tim blogged about <a href="node/268.html">his most recent happening</a> with Aspiration, and he did a great job describing it (much better than I could ever do).  In a nutshell, people from different open source projects got together to brainstorm how to make products more user-friendly.  (Gosh, I hope I said that right!)  Really though, you should <a href="node/268.html">read Tim&#39;s blog</a>...he makes it sound a lot cooler.  Take &#39;em away, Tim!</p>
<p>Corey has been working on updating training materials for Pangea as well.  In the hardware aspect of things, she repaired a broken power button for one of their servers.  Go Corey!</p>
<p>Andrea&#39;s office was recently feng shui&#39;d to ensure that her office is in harmony with her environment. :)  She&#39;s been working on figuring out how her agency can host the <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/">Media That Matters</a> festival (remember that from PSO?!).  In addition, she&#39;s been focusing on volunteer stuff and working with the Library of Congress on gathering the stories of veterans.  Awesome, Andrea!</p>
<p><strong>Remember!</strong></p>
<p>If you haven&#39;t updated your contact information yet, do it now!  Make sure your agency information especially is listed and correct in your personal profile.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s a wrap!  I hope you enjoyed hearing what the TANs have been up to!</p>

<p>Thanks  for giving a detailed account of what has happened in last <br />monthly teleconference meeting for Technology Assistance for Non-profits group.  <br />Unfortunately I had to miss that meeting on account of being sick with cold and therefore it fills me in on what I have missed. I am doing O.K and my downtime project work is progressing at a reasonable pace.</p>

				<p>So I got a package in the mail the other day from home and I wasn&#39;t expecting anything in the mail.  So I was curious what was going on.  I went ahead and opened it and my family sent me some drinking glasses that are sports themed for Wisconsin sports.  I was really super excited about this and I haven&#39;t put the badger glass down since I have gotten it.  It was such a simple but nice gift because I do not have any nice drinking glasses.  My family is great.  Of course...I took photos! :)</p>

				<p>Last weekend Aspiration co-hosted a Usuability Sprint at Google in Silicon Valley.  The purpose of this sprint was to bring together designers of Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) software with &quot;usability experts&quot;, with the hope that some good design work could be done to make the products more user-friendly.   Google provided most of the usability experts, and the open source projects represented were <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, Sustainable Civil Society, <a href="http://www.socialtext.com/">SocialText</a>, <a href="http://hyperscope.org/">HyperScope</a>, and of course, <a href="http://www.socialsourcecommons.org/">Social Source Commons</a> (represented by Gunner and me).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, I need to say that Google is awesome.  They provided the meeting space and food for the weekend completely free of charge to anyone.  We had constant access to snacks and drinks, and even got a &quot;shwag bag&quot; of free stuff.  Aside from that, Google seems to really go out of their way to make their employees happy, from the free snacks and drinks to the kitchens on every floor, to the free laundry service there.  Needless to say, I was very impressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also got a lot of work done for Social Source Commons.  We are in the process of adding &quot;COmmunity Toolboxes&quot; as a feature, and we spent the weekend designing the relevent pages for this new feature in order to ensure that we have all the functionality covered.  We did a lot of good work, and developed some nice wireframes that we sent to our developers to integrated into the website.  Hopefully we should have those up and running soon, because the value added by having &quot;Community Toolboxes&quot; will really help SSC to provide value to nonprofits and those providing them with technical assistance.  I&#39;ll blog more about Community Toolboxes later, when we incorporate them into the website. </p>

	    <p>For those of you interested, which is probably nobody, I would like to point out that &quot;shwag&quot; and &quot;swag&quot; are not the same thing.  </p>
<p>&quot;Shwag&quot; is free promotional crap given out by companies.  </p>
<p>&quot;Swag&quot; is an Aussie term for a rolled bundle of belongings, carried by a foot traveler.  It can also refer to &quot;loot&quot;, such as that plundered by pirates.  </p>
<p>The only exception to this is if you happen to be at a trade show for a <a href="http://www.epirate.com">pirate startup company</a>, and you steal some of their promotional items.  In that case, either word is acceptable.</p>

	    <p>well garriet you&#39;ld be surprised to know that this is relevant at our office.  We have been talking about schwag and calling it pirate booty.

				<p>Before I became a Vista, I naively hoped that the health benefits provided to us would include dental care. Thus, I put off getting my teeth cleaned and checked until when I thought my time of lacking insurance would be over.<br /><br /></p>
<p>At this point I haven't been to the dentist in a while, so when I recently read an article called <a href="http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Insurance/InsureYourHealth/AsurvivalGuideForTheUninsured.aspx">A survival guide for the uninsured</a> (containing such cheerful news as "The more than 45 million Americans without coverage will get sick more, earn less and die earlier than those with insurance") the best piece of info I got from it was the idea to try to find cheap dental care at dental schools.<br /><br /></p>
<p>I'd heard of people doing that before but hadn't occurred to me lately. It seemed like a good plan. Unfortunately, apparently lots of others think so too. The only dental school in my state takes new patients through a long process which involves being selected through a monthly lottery, being screened via form answers to see if there is a current educational need for you, being placed on a waiting list for up to 6 months, and finally being given a screening appointment to see if they want to work with you. All that for low-cost dental care with people who aren't even dentists yet.<br /><br /></p>
<p>But maybe you'll have better luck - here's a <a href="http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/HealthInformation/FindingDentalCare/DentalSchools.htm">list of dental schools</a>.<br /><br /></p>
<p>In other news, my office has ants. They seem to have formed a colony or something in my trash can. Maybe this'll teach me to take out the trash more than never.</p>

				<p class="MsoNormal">At present my work is focused mainly on a small software development project for which I write code in php. <span> </span>I have to write code to interact with a database and generate forms and reports.</p>
<p>  Among the tools I am using for this project, Pear::DB and Smarty are more significant. PEAR is allowing me to write code which is database neutral. That is I do not have to write database functions addressed to a specific database. I need to do it only once in a single statement when I connect to a database of my choice. This is a cool concept that allows portability. For example same code can be used to connect to MySQL or SQLite or PostgresSQL data bases with changes only to configuration parameters. <br />
</p><p class="MsoNormal">Another tool that I am using is “Smarty templates” for report layout. With Smarty I can<span>  </span><span> </span>write code separating presentation details from the processing logic. Additionally Smarty allows me to use conditional logic and looping within the template, thus allowing me to separate not only the template but also the logic, this ability to use some level of logic, instead  of just plugging in the variables, gives me more control over the display</p>
<p>  For example I have been able to code the display of a form containing a list box filled with the results of a data base query. I am also able to create a table, populated with records from database with a layout based on a condition. Using smarty has simplified and reduced my php code as well. I find, having HTML files (templates)separated from PHP files is convenient in terms of running through HTML validator, linking to style sheets, debugging and editing.</p>

				<p>I am currently reworking an old website for HPP, <a href="http://digitalartscorps.org/www.helping-sf.org" target="_blank">Helping-SF</a>.  This website is meant for low-income families and case managers.  In it&#39;s current form, the website is very disorganized both in terms of content and also in terms of pages and locations.  There are numerous broken links, orphaned pages and older versions housed within numerous local locations.  Although I have some experience with dreamweaver, I have never moved an existing site to a new location.  I am not sure if it would be better to work with the existing local files and reorganize that way or whether I should migrate the site to a local folder and start fresh.  Any suggestions?  </p>
<p>ALSO, I cannot log into the CTC Vista Project site from my computer in the office, but I can from other computers in the office.  I was able to when I first started, but I have not been able to since.   Any suggestions on how I can change that?  This is the reason for my posting lack in the last couple of weeks.  </p>

	    <p>i would suggest, you start with an analysis of the current site and make lists of it&#39;s plus points and minus points. then talk with others in the organization and make lists of must-haves, like-to-haves.</p>
<p> site migration should be easy enough - it is usually just copying the files to the new location. i would strongly recommend that you divide the project into parts so it is easier to handle and don&#39;t forget to save a copy of all the old files (just in case to a cd). i&#39;ve waded thru a couple of site migrations and i&#39;d be happy to help; let me know via email or phone. </p>
