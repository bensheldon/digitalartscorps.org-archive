				<p>I&#39;ve been in California for a month and a half now and I love it! I found a place to live in Alameda which is just outside of Oakland where I work. Alameda is really nice and safe. I love my job and the people I work with are really cool! </p>
<p>I have been busy with a few projects at work. I developed an addition to their 3 hour Take Home Computer Class (THCP). This class provides Oakland students in grades 6-12 with basic computer training along with training on the Open Source software (OpenOffice, The Gimp, Audacity, typing tutors, anti-virus, anti-spyware, etc.) that we install on each computer. Once the students take the class,  then they receive a free refurbished computer with free life time tech support. </p>
<p>I made an OpenOffice Impress presentation (software similar and compatible to PowerPoint) that explains Dial-up, DSL, and Cable Internet service (Wireless discussion will be added soon). I developed this addition because I noticed that the instructors would always get a lot of questions about these types of Internet services. Students didn&#39;t know the differences between them or how they worked, etc. I actually teach this portion of the class and explain in more detail about these technologies as I show them my presentation. My addition to the class is a success. The students and parents have a better understanding about how these technologies work. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve also been working on the new OTX-West website  (<a href="http://otxwest.org/" target="_blank" title="OTX-West" class="links">www.otxwest.org</a>) using Dreamweaver. That&#39;s a lot of fun. I&#39;ve never used Dreamweaver before so I am getting some hands on experience. </p>
<p>Finally, I&#39;ve been working with the director of curriculum on this summers digital storytelling workshop. We are in the process of revamping the curriculum and adding a web development part to it as well. I&#39;m planing on going to <a href="http://www.storycenter.org/index1.html" target="_blank" title="The Center for Digital Storytelling" class="links">The Center for Digital Story Telling </a>in Berkeley, CA to see how they do their workshops and to get more information on how we can improve our workshop. There is a CTC VISTA working there already so I&#39;ll be getting in touch with her soon.  I also have been learning the Open Source software that we use to create the digital stories (<a href="http://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank" title="The Gimp" class="links">The Gimp</a>,  <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" title="Audacity" class="links">Audacity</a>, <a href="http://www.audiograbber.com-us.net/" target="_blank" title="Audiograbber" class="links">Audiograbber</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/index.html" target="_blank" title="OpenOffice" class="links">OpenOffice</a>, <a href="http://www.nvu.com/index.php" target="_blank" title="Nvu">Nvu</a>). </p>
<p>Anyway, that&#39;s it for now. I attached an OpenOffice Impress copy and PowerPoint compatible copy of my slide show. The PowerPoint copy may alter the formatting and animations that were used in the OpenOffice Impress version but you can get the jist of it. </p>
<p> Until next time....</p>

	    <p>Naomi--Thanks for bringing it to my attention that we don't have the upload file types allowed for ODF documents.   </p>
<p>Now you should be able to upload extensions with .odt, .ods, .odp, and .odg. I'm happy to hear you're using them. </p>
<p>Also, for anyone on a Mac, <a href="http://www.neooffice.org/">NeoOffice</a> is a great port of <a href="http://openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a>.</p>
<p>Also, my favorite open source drawing app is <a href="http://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>, a vector drawing program somewhat similar to illustrator, but easier to use.</p>

			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p>My wife is a native Philippine naturalized<br />
American citizen.</p>
<p>I met and married her in the Philippines -<br />
22 years ago.</p>
<p>I am bi-racial - black and white on<br />
both parents sides of the family.</p>
<p>And I am working for a NP Latino / Chicano<br />
support service.</p>
<p>I grew up in a predominantly black community<br />
in Minnesota - "Selby - Dale" area - Twin<br />
cities.  It was more black than it is now.<br />
It is now, thanx to an influx of Vietnamese<br />
refugees in the mid to late 70's far more<br />
Hmong.</p>
<p>Going to Highline Community College here,<br />
I've been exposed to people of many different<br />
countries and cultures - European, Indian,<br />
Asian, Philippine, African, Caribbean, and<br />
more.</p>
<p>For the record, I think it's a GREAT thing and<br />
have said so on several occasions in the process<br />
of my entry into service for Americorps and to<br />
my current service NP - El Centro de la Raza.</p>
<p>And I am aware that no one knows exactly what it's<br />
like to walk in my shoes anymore than I know what<br />
it's like to walk in theirs.</p>
<p>But, thanks to my wife, I have some insight into<br />
life in the Philippines and Filipino life here in<br />
America - in the Pacific Northwest, and before<br />
that, in Southern California.</p>
<p>A world I did not and would not have more than<br />
the most cursory of understandings of, I have,<br />
because of my experiences with my wife and<br />
because she takes the time to act as translator,<br />
interpreter for me.</p>
<p>Likewise, I can be translator / interpreter for<br />
what my experiences are as someone who<br />
is bi-racial, which in and of itself is not special.<br />
So many of us are.  I just happen to be bi-racial<br />
of the two most polarized ethnicities in America -<br />
black and white.</p>
<p>I am grateful that, at El Centro de la Raza, where<br />
the dominant language is Spanish, they have<br />
graciously extended a welcome to me - "su<br />
casa es mi casa" - their house is my house.<br />
With patience and persistence I am being allowed<br />
a window into the experiences of Latino/a,<br />
Chicano/a life / history in America in the Pacific<br />
Northwest.</p>
<p>At the beginning of my service, at the PSO, I asked<br />
of a panel of current Vistas, "Someone once said,<br />
'Every man is my superior in that I may learn from<br />
him'.  In that vein, we go off to our respective NPs and<br />
offer our services, but, what do you, have you learned,<br />
taken away from your service from those you've<br />
served?"</p>
<p>In my service, I am learning that hospitality is<br />
cross-cultural.  Each culture in its own way.  In the<br />
Philippines I was invited to parties simply because<br />
they were having them.  At El Centro de la Raza,<br />
I've been to a mini Tejana concert by Los Texas<br />
Maniacs.  While I don't fully understand Spanish,<br />
like any language, it has it's rhythms.  It's musicality.<br />
As I learned of Japanese over three years on Okinawa<br />
island in the Marine Corps.  As I have learned of<br />
Tagalog, over 25 plus years with my wife and before<br />
her on numerous trips to the Philippines.  And Korean,<br />
on training operations in South Korea.  </p>
<p>I may not understand what's being said.  But, smiles<br />
are universal, as is sadness, despair, and hope, anger<br />
and frustration, as well as empathy and compassion.</p>
<p>I hope to, at the end of my term, be able to report back,<br />
that not only did I make a difference in increasing the<br />
capacity and ability of my NP to do their job, I will also<br />
be able to say I made some friends and shared a warm<br />
and welcome window into a culture which up to this point<br />
I had only experienced largely from the outside looking in.<br />
I hope to be able to report back, what I have learned and<br />
waht insights I have gained for what they're worth.</p>
<p>If I'm luck enough, I hope to continue my service with them<br />
after Americorp.  If not, I hope I'm lucky enough to find other<br />
gainful employment either with Americorps or some other<br />
service organization.  I've got my eye on what Barbara<br />
Ehrenreich of "Nickel and Dimed" and "Bait and Switch"<br />
authorship has currently got going to attempt to address<br />
employment issues of the disenfranchised:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.barbaraehrenreich.com" title="http://www.barbaraehrenreich.com">http://www.barbaraehrenreich.com</a></p>
<p>But that's down the road.  I have no idea if she has any openings<br />
or use for me, but, as a fifty something, still very much in the job market<br />
and at the lower end, she is addressing issues very much relevant<br />
to where my life and circumstance, anc others, comparably, is now.</p>
<p>I'd like to be able to contribute something useful towards her<br />
ends, if I could.</p>
<p>I'm certainly having a GREAT time where I am now.  </p>
<p>Ours is a very easygoing, hardworking, collaborative crowd and<br />
we all care very much about El Centro de la Raza.  As I'm sure<br />
many of you do about the NPs you are serving.</p>
<p>I am a child of the civil rights movement.  I was alive when John<br />
and Robert Kennedy were assassinated - and when Martin and<br />
Malcolm were assassinated.</p>
<p>I'm not so sure I still believe in the civil rights model of the 60s.<br />
But, I am absolutely optimistic that this current generation of<br />
increasingly intermingled and intermarrying 20 and 30 and<br />
40 somethings will usher in a new generation of tolerance and<br />
understanding that I have been lucky enough to see in my lifetime,<br />
but, will not live long enough to see the promises fulfilled.</p>
<p>I have every confidence that the end of this century will be nothing<br />
like its beginning.  It will be, I hope, so much better.</p>
<p>And I'd like to think that the kinds of people and work that's being<br />
done through Americorps and NPs like El Centro de la Raza and<br />
others addressing the needs of an increasingly multicultural community<br />
are helping to bring about that difference.</p>
<p>But, what do I know?</p>
<p>Take care.  Hope you're having fun.</p>

				<p>Back in January, the folks at the Community Software Lab were asked by a university-based non-profit if we could translate an artist&#39;s Photoshop mock-up into HTML and CSS.  Eager to please (and needing some money to keep the budget balanced), we said &quot;sure&quot; and submitted our estimate for 20 hours of work.  It&#39;s March, and we&#39;re still working.  What&#39;s the deal?</p>
<p>For my part, I gratefully ignored things until the last week of February, content to let Dan, my boss, manage the project.  He had subcontracted the work to Erich, our soon-to-be VISTA, and for the most part, let things be, receiving changes from Erich every few days.  It worked great--as long as changes didn&#39;t need to be made immediately.  Erich put together some pretty good code and certainly earned his 20 hours&#39; paycheck.  Then things began to pick up.</p>
<p>Dan and I met with our clients and their contractor, hired to handle eZ publish, the content management system (CMS) behind the existing website.  At this point, we were asked to clean up a few errors in our code, and Dan asked me to take over managing our end of the project.</p>
<p>&quot;Sounds fun!&quot; I thought.  This initial enthusiasm has kept me at times from tearing my hair out.</p>
<p>First task: talk with Erich and find out how many hours he&#39;s worked.  Seventeen.  Cool.  He can fix the styling errors and fill out his 20 hours.  I can stay detached from the actual coding and work on learning server virtualization, adding Gallery to another client&#39;s website, debugging our Samba server, and installing SMTP authentication on our mail server.   It hasn&#39;t turned out that way.</p>
<p>Behind every website is HTML.  Perhaps that&#39;s a bit of a simplification, but it&#39;s not too far off.  HTML is the end product of every website designed for a personal computer.  The web browser knows HTML, and the web browser is boss.  It then stands to reason that a large part of any website&#39;s success is based on what sort of HTML it gives to the browser.  Wonderful HTML doesn&#39;t guarantee a good site, but improperly written HTML throws a wrench in the works.   It causes some browsers to balk while others work fine.  Text turns into links; links turn into text.  Cats and dogs live together.  Well, it&#39;s not quite Ghostbusters-bad.</p>
<p>A big chunk of the issue hinges on the very first line after the server tells the browser &quot;Content-type: text/html&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&quot; -- that pesky &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration (man, I hope Drupal escapes this sentence correctly!).  This guy tells the browser which version of HTML is being delivered.  There a few different versions these days, but the big ones are XHTML 1.0 and HTML 4.01.  XHTML is newer and more programmer-/machine-friendly; HTML requires fewer tags.  The crux of the issue, though, is how the browser handles each.  Most browsers these days display content differently depending on the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration they receive with each page.  Give them an XHTML 1.0 declaration, they do one thing; give them an HTML 4.01 declaration, they do another.  Thanks to the trial and error of many web developers, this behavior is pretty well documented.  Give a browser one declaration, but give it code corresponding to a different declaration--then you have problems.</p>
<p>The old site used the HTML 4.01 declaration, but which declaration to use for the new site?  We chose XHTML.  It&#39;s definitely easier to spot flaws in an XHTML page, and stylesheets work differently with XHTML than with HTML.  Mostly, though, it&#39;s an aesthetic thing.  With XHTML there is no ambiguity.  Every tag has a beginning an and ending, and its content is determined by the beginning and the ending of the tag, not by the browser&#39;s interpretation of the tag, as is sometimes the case with HTML 4.01.  Ask someone else, though, and you&#39;d likely receive a different answer.   The point here is that there are pitfalls involved with converting a site from HTML 4.01 to XHTML 1.0.  Beware of this.  Don&#39;t do it just because it&#39;s trendy.   Even though we&#39;re using a content management system, we&#39;ll still be uncovering small bugs a month from now.</p>
<p>Back in January, I first received the artists&#39; mock-up as an e-mail attachment.  I was cc&#39;ed on the e-mail.  Trouble was, in addition to the mock-up, there were two other image attachments along for the ride--a pdf file of the entire mock-up and a gif file of five pictures, arranged in a row, artfully merged together.  What to do?</p>
<p>Well, as a bystander, I did nothing for a month.  Fortunately I kept the e-mail, though I must say I rarely delete e-mails.  When I finally started working on the project, we were asked to smooth out the site&#39;s banner image.  It seemed a bit blurry, but I wasn&#39;t sure why.  I asked Erich to take a look and send me an updated image.</p>
<p>Still in error-fixing mode, we needed to keep the left-hand navigation links from resizing if a word got too long.  We also needed to keep the main content from dropping below the left-hand navigation when the browser window got too small.  Where it existed, we also needed to update the right-hand column.</p>
<p>(End of Part One) </p>

				<p>Hello to all!  It has been a very long time since I have blogged!  Things here in Tennessee are going fine, although busy!  I spent the entire month of December and most of February making fudge to raise money for the STAR Center.  The fudge seems to be a very popular item, as well as a great gift to give or to receive.  We raised about $15,000 with 2 fudge sales (one for Christmas and one for Valentine&#39;s Day).  With each fundraiser, we included the option to have the fudge delivered to a person&#39;s home or place of business, and I recruited volunteers to help with delivery.  For anyone who is interested, here is the recipe:</p>
<p>Heat 2/3 cup evaporated milk, 1 1/2 sticks butter or margarine, and 3 cups sugar over medium high heat, stirring constantly. </p>
<p>As the mixture begins to boil, set a timer for 4 minutes.  After your 4 minutes is up, remove the mixture from heat.  Stir in 2 cups chocolate chips until well mixed.  Add 1 jar marshmallow cream and 1 tsp. vanilla, and stir until well blended (You have to work pretty fast because the fudge sets up quickly). </p>
<p> After all ingredients are mixed together well, pour the fudge into mold of your choice.  If using small molds, the silicone ones work best.  We made star-shaped for Christmas and heart-shaped for Valentine&#39;s Day.  Instead of using small molds, you can also pour the fudge into a 13 x 9 inch pan and cut it into smaller pieces.  After the fudge is completely set, remove from the molds and enjoy!</p>
<p>For another flavor variation, we made peanut butter fudge the same way but with peanut butter chips instead of chocolate.  We also made white chocolate raspberry with white chocolate chips and raspberry flavoring in place of the vanilla.   </p>

				<p>Last week I had the opportunity to participate in my first &quot;sprint&quot;. In a sprint, a bunch of people get together and work on an open source project for a few days. In my two days (and one night :p) of sprinting, I learned a lot, met some awesome people, and contributed to the start of a project. I highly recommend sprinting to anyone who gets a chance to do it.</p>
<p>However, one thing I noticed when sprinting was the difficulty of getting to a point where you can make progress on a project. For example, before you could work on my project, you had to download and install particular versions of six different tools. And then you had configure your system properly (set environment variables and run scripts and such). </p>
<p>If there were nice installers that worked for all platforms for the tools, maybe it wouldn&#39;t have been so bad. But there are often not installers, and all the tasks multiply -- you have to install other things to allow you to install the things you actually need. Here is the <a href="http://initd.org/pub/software/pysqlite/doc/install-source-win32.html">Windows install page for one of the tools</a> my project required, for example.</p>
<p>(There are perhaps the most issues in getting set up on Windows, maybe because most open source developers are not using Windows so they sometimes don&#39;t bother to document for it and they sometimes don&#39;t have an easy way to test things on Windows. But I think this is a serious issue. <a href="http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=2">Most people are using Windows.</a> If we want anyone to be able to join open source development efforts, we have to make it possible for people to start contributing on the platform they already have.) </p>
<p>I was able to get the stuff I needed running after a few hours because there were people around who I could ask for help when I got stuck. And luckily my pretty-old (from before college) laptop did not collapse from the weight of the tools. But what about the person alone in their apartment who just wants to contribute? And what if they only have a dialup connection?</p>
<p>It&#39;s not like people who have trouble getting the tools setup don&#39;t have anything to contribute. But we aren&#39;t letting them get to a point where they can. I mentioned the issues in getting started to some other sprinters and they said &quot;Yes, the barrier to entry for open source development is high.&quot; But no one mentioned anything that is being done about it. </p>
<p>What can we do to make it easier to contribute? Produce better documentation? (Lack of documentation is already a big problem in the open source world.) Set up more ways for programmers to connect to one another in person? Make better operating systems so tool setup goes more smoothly?</p>

			 	<div class="post-content-text">
				<p>A hearing for funding for my NP.</p>
<p>I learned that:</p>
<p>To reserve a seat, you've got to leave something on it.</p>
<p>Seating is at a premium.</p>
<p>The lineup may be numerical in order (according to Bill #)<br />
 but, those who go first, speak longest.</p>
<p>There are rules.</p>
<p>Rules are subject to change.</p>
<p>You learn just how well a case can be made in your favor<br />
inside of one to two minutes - tops. We made our case<br />
in about 1 minute, 40 seconds.  As an exercise take<br />
anything you value highly and make a persuasive case<br />
for it in under two minutes...'tain't easy.</p>
<p>And it's just as easy to get lost there (Olympia, WA) as<br />
anywhere else - which I did - as I seem to in almost every<br />
new city I've ever been to - at least once.</p>
<p>If approved our legislation would grant $ 821,000 for<br />
building renovation - specifically roof renovation.</p>
<p>Next it must be passed out of committee, preferably with<br />
a "Do Pass" recommendation after which, hopefully, it<br />
will be brought to a vote by the full house and then, hopefully<br />
passed, after which, hopefully, it will be signed into law by<br />
our governor Chris (formerly Christine) Gregoire, formerly<br />
state attorney general.</p>
<p>The entire process lasted from 1:30 to 3:30 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>We were last in line of three bills and were given, among 21<br />
speakers of which only a mere fraction presented their case,<br />
one half hour.  Still we finished early.</p>
<p>The rest is up to the legislature.</p>
<p>The bills' signature rosters are set out for signature before every<br />
hearing and support or opposition can sign in and signify support<br />
or opposition as well as whether or not they care to speak at the<br />
hearing.</p>
<p>I think they should make it clear that brevity increases the likelihood<br />
of favorable consideration.  Hearings would take a lot less time,<br />
probably cost a lot less and be far more interesting as a result.</p>
<p>But as a very intelligent woman (from Parade Magazine) once said,<br />
"There's my money, your money, and his money. You're always more<br />
careful with your own money." </p>
<p>The lightest moment of the hearing was when a legislative sponsor<br />
(our bill) said he always tried to emulate the dress and behavior of<br />
those he most respects (in this case, the committee chair, who he<br />
had made a point to dress very similarly to - pink shirt, pink tie).  The<br />
committee chair got  a good chuckle out of that.  Whether or not it makes<br />
a difference in support will remain to be seen.</p>
<p>The bill is HB 2325.  You can read more about it here:</p>
<p><a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?bill=2325&amp;year=2007">HB 2325 Community Development Fund</a></p>

				<p>Santa Monica's air is crisp and clear today. Happily, that's how my head feels. Looking back on my accomplishments (and struggles) of the past year, I'm pleased with the work I've done and the knowledge I've gained. My VISTA year has given me so many opportunities and experiences for which I am grateful.<br /></p>
<p>
Helping to build a Web site from the ground up, engaging with an activist community using Web tools and learning about policy and advocacy work from a firsthand perspective were valuable experiences and helped me shape my vision for the future and decide what I want my place in the world to be. <br /></p>
<p>
I had challenges too, both technical ones (CivicSpace is tricky) and real life ones (Food Stamps can be hard to get), but perhaps what matters more than what I've done is where I'm going to go with the insight I've gained.<br /></p>
<p>
 I've recently accepted a full-time staff position here at The Children's Partnership as the technology program associate and will continue to work on children's access to technology. My position will end in late August when I leave for New York to pursue a master's in urban policy analysis and management. I cannot overstate how pricipal my service year was as an enabliing step toward achieving larger goals. Thanks again to everyone who has supported me and shared their expertise. It's been real.<br /></p>

				<p>There has been a lot going on in my neck of the woods (San Diego, CA). </p>
<p><strong>Work</strong>:<br /> For one thing, my company, the Pangea Foundation, was just granted a contract to develop databasing software to be used in the <a href="http://www.ecd.org" title="Enterprise Corporation of the Delta">Home Again Mississippi</a> project (I think that is the project; If not, you get to see a cool webpage with stories). It is really such an honor that a company as small as ours was chosen to do such an enormous project. Unfortunately, though, we only have until March 30th to finish (people need homes!) and we just found out we got the job yesterday! Craziness! The gist is that there was some sort of insurance/state relief decision made where select people are each being given $100,000 to rebuild/repair their homes. However, the state of Mississippi has no way to track who needs it, at what stage they&#39;re at or any of the other details that go along with it. So along comes Pangea to the rescue! They saw some of our other systems and have heard about our great tech support and training assistance (ya baby) and felt we were the company for them. It&#39;s so exciting! Our software will hopefully expedite the process of all of the people getting the funds they need to rebuild their homes. Woot!</p>
<p>Second, Laura and I went to a Cultural Proficiency seminar last Friday that was very interesting. Many of the counselors who we are working with on our new AP Tracking system were there so it was good to network with them in addition to learning about cultural differences and how to overcome them.</p>
<p>Third, the mentoring program for which we have been working on a tracking system has been growing by leaps and bounds! It used to be just Wednesday mornings but then there was a waiting list to get involved! So now there is a Thursday morning session as well! (That was a lot of exclamation points, I apologize.) We help Karen, the program director at our office, get things organized and input all of the new data for the programs. It&#39;s been fun and I&#39;m glad it&#39;s growing. </p>
<p><strong>Moving away from work onto daytrips and fun times:</strong> </p>
<p>Laura, Mike Denegal (former VISTA leader) and I took a daytrip to Tijuana on Sunday. </p>
<p><img src="http://digitalartscorps.org/files/user963/Tijuana_030_compressed.jpg" alt="Pangea crew in TJ" title="Pangea crew in TJ" hspace="5" width="448" height="336" align="left" /> </p>
<p>It was way too much fun. Here&#39;s a link for <a href="http://pepperdine.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2023805&amp;l=15b98&amp;id=8501288">pictures</a>. Check them out! It was cool because we took the trolley from our office which was only $5 roundtrip and were able to just walk across the border, thereby missing all of the traffic and wait times! Everything is pretty cheap down there and there is a lot going on. If you ever make it to San Diego, it’s totally a fun thing to do. </p>
<p>Laura and I have also been taking some free classes at one of the continuing education campuses here in San Diego. We started off with HTML and then moved onto Dreamweaver (all the way through intermediate!) and Photoshop. It’s so cool to be able to learn new skills and expand horizons! There is totally one of those guys who can’t keep his hand down in lecture and likes to argue with the teacher (you all know what I’m talking about) but besides that, class is awesome.</p>
<p>Otherwise, fun things I’ve been doing include going to cheap local concerts, watching movies and baking. Oh yeah, and doing Tae Bo videos with new and improved Billy Bands (yeah, I’m weird)! You guys are going to see Laura and me at the conference and be like, “Dang, those girls are svelte.” Just kidding…</p>
<p><strong>Thought provoking life questions:</strong></p>
<p>I came to the realization the other day that my VISTA term is nearly half over. What that really means is that my year of procrastination that was to be used for deciding what I wanted to do with the rest of my life is nearly half over. I feel like I haven’t come to any real conclusions. I really like technology and when I work at it, I can learn and accomplish a lot, but I’m no techy genius, unlike many of my fellow VISTAs out there! I just don’t feel I have a ton to offer sometimes. I majored in business and I am pretty good at that – organizing, planning, implementing, etc. I could draw you a pretty nice supply/demand graph any day of the week. However, I’ve found that really putting things into practice is often difficult. All I really know is that I want to be useful and I want to help people but I don’t know in what area I can do that most efficiently. I know I don’t want to go back to school. I should probably move away from San   Diego for an adventure and growth but it’s just so comfortable here for me. My family is here, my friends are here, I know my way around (Anyone who knows me well knows that is huge because I have absolutely NO sense of direction). So yeah, anyone out there in the same boat? Have any suggestions or ideas? </p>
<p>Hope everyone is doing well and that no one has frozen over with the recent weather. Looking forward to seeing many of you in April at NTEN!</p>

	    <p>Thats pretty sweet about the new contract for Pangaea.  I think you guys are giving them the support they need to grow, even if sometimes it seems like you aren&#39;t doing much.  I take it that that contract is the reason you were in meetings all yesterday...which again, is a good thing.</p>
<p>Awesome on the html, dreamweaver and photoshop classes...free is an excellent price indeed. I also am finally learning the basics of HTML after fooling around with Dreamweaver a couple of years ago, i&#39;ve made webpages, but didnt know the nitty-gritty html stuff, so i&#39;m learning the code basics.  Also you heard about my training in Macromedia Flash here in old town alexandria, which is so sweet. If only we could actually purchase the software....[looks into the distance dreamily].</p>
<p>I also understand your existential and career contemplation, but i think you already have more of a plan than you give yourself credit.  Go crazy, be adventurous and use that americorps resume and networking for your benefit.  Heck...move out to DC, its a great area and lots of fun stuff to do.  And lots of jobs that are interested in supply/demand graphs. </p>
<p>See ya in April.</p>

				<p>hey guys whats up. sorry for not blogging. its been busy over here at reelworks. one class is finishing up and another is starting. well thanks to the good folks at listenup i was able to go to sundance. l<span class="Apple-style-span">Listen Up! is a youth media network that connects young video producers and their allies to resources, support, and projects in order to develop the field and achieve an authentic youth voice in the mass media.</span> 
<div>if you work at a youth media organization you should definatly  get involved with them. you can find out more at listenup.org. yea sundance was amazing. the trip was funded by adobe youth voices and we had to get a mentor and make a video. that was the boring part of the trip. i saw about 6 movies and they were all great. a couple of them are coming out in theatres. i met alot of people. i represented reelworks every possible second i was at sundance. spoke to alot of filmmakers. alot of them were intrested in becoming a mentor at reelworks. overall it was the best experience of my life. sundance made me realize that i want to be a filmmaker. last week there was a deadline for &quot; the Lot&quot; a reality tv show that steven spielberg is doing about filmmakers 13 and up. i had to submit a short film. my doc was to long and to vulgar so i had 1 week to write shoot and edit another. so i made some calls got some of the most talented people i know. a great cameraman and the greatest make up artists under 20. with 50 bucks i made a cool zombie movie. it didnt turn out as good as i intended but it will do. i&#39;ll try to put it up so you guys can watch it if you want. well i hope this blog makes up for not blogging in a while</div>

				<p><span>Anyone else starting to think about what you’re going to do after done with your CTC VISTA term of service?<span>  </span>(I’m only about 5 ½ months in…) I’ve been trying to figure it out since day one practically.<span>  </span>Don’t get me wrong; it’s not because I hate what I’m doing and am counting the days until I’m done.<span>  </span>Far from it, in fact!<span>  </span>I love what I’m doing, I love the people I’m working with, I love where I work, the list goes on!<span>  </span></span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Part of the reason why I chose to be a member of the AmeriCorps VISTA program for a second year is because I didn’t know what I wanted to do after completing my first year.<span>  </span>Sure, I had a much better idea, but the options were so numerous, and I didn’t feel ready to decide what I wanted to do with the rest of my life career-wise.<span>  </span>So I decided to take another year to try to make up my mind (among other things), but wanted to continue to make a difference while learning something new.<span>  </span>(My first year as a VISTA member was spent managing volunteers, planning events, creating publications, and doing research for the homeless coalition in Indianapolis…COMPLETELY different from what I’m doing now so I can’t even compare the two.)<span>  </span></span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Learn new things I have.<span>  </span>I honestly never imagined that I would have any sort of technical position because I didn’t have the background (I graduated with a degree in audiology and speech-language pathology), but here I am testing software and providing technical support, to name a couple things.<span>  </span>And I’m finding out it’s not so bad.<span>  </span>And a few HTML, Dreamweaver, and Photoshop classes later, I’m finding out it’s really pretty neat.</span><span> </span></p>

	    <p>Hey Laura,</p>
<p>Ever think of being a VISTA Leader? ;)</p>
<p>No but seriously, I just had an email exchange with Ray who's finishing in June about this same thing.  And I've been thinking about how the Project can be better about end of service support (and alumni relations too).  There's lots of stuff on the Corporation's website (see <a href="http://encorps.nationalserviceresources.org/resources/moving_on/laa_movingphp.php" title="http://encorps.nationalserviceresources.org/resources/moving_on/laa_movingphp.php">http://encorps.nationalserviceresources.org/resources/moving_on/laa_movi...</a>) but it's so generalized, it's a bit frustrating.</p>
<p>But my gut feeling is that most of the CTC VISTAs I've heard that have moved on but are still in the field met their future employers as a VISTA - either folks get a job at the org they served at or met someone in their work that hooked them into a project.  So keep your eyes peeled and your networking skills honed now!</p>

				<p>There is an issue that I have found interesting since I first discovered it in one of my communication classes at Grand Valley State University. It was a realization. And the beginning of one of my disagreements with the world. It has come up twice recently with different people. So it is on my mind again.</p>
<p>The textbook was saying that in any communication that there is an Intended message from the person creating the message (by talking, writing, making a movie, etc) and there is a Perceived message that the listener/viewer receives. And the shattering moment for me, <em>they aren&#39;t always the same</em>. I know it seems pretty obvious now, but i was young, right? Psychologically, I think I have a strong desire to be understood, so this revelation was kind of sad to me.</p>
<p>Both the text and my teacher seemed to be saying that the Perceived message of the receiver WAS the message. They said that was <em>the</em> important component. I disagreed. My argument was and is that the Indented message IS the REAL message, if the Perceived message differs from the Intended one then the perception is incorrect.</p>
<p>That doesn&#39;t mean I blame the receiver of the message for getting it wrong. Many messages are poorly communicated. Or translated. During the Cold War Nikita Khrushchev was quoted in the west as saying, &quot;We will bury you.&quot; What he was saying in the context of his culture and society was, &quot;We will out last you.&quot; But in the west the implications of the word &#39;bury&#39;, made it seem like a threatening statement.</p>
<p>No one can blame the already scared masses for the misunderstanding. Yet, the message that Mr. Khrushchev intended is still THE actual message in my book, even if the whole world misunderstood.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why I believe it is very important to be clear and concise and honest. To mean what you say. And to know the meanings of the words you are using. I&#39;m not a perfect communicator by any stretch of the imagination. But I strive to be.</p>
<p>Now there are lots of times that in order for someone to really learn something, they have to discover it for themselves. Just telling someone something flat out doesn&#39;t always get the message across. This is true of students. To really engage students, to get real learning you have to lead a student to water. And it&#39;s up to the student to drink or not.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t give a student a piece of literature like, Macbeth and sit around saying how great it is, telling them all the little things Shakespeare has put in there. You have to let them think it out for themselves, or they are just going to glaze over and be bored.</p>
<p>There are other instances when people are not ready to hear certain information, usually for emotional or psychological reasons. And similarly just telling someone something that they likely do NEED to hear doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll hear it. You have to lay out the evidence.</p>
<p>When someone has just broke up with a lover, flat out saying, &quot;S/he is never coming back,&quot; isn&#39;t a wise choice, because the person is just going to go into denial and not listen. It&#39;s better to give examples of similar situations and subtly relay facts like, &quot;s/he has a new girl/boyfriend,&quot; and let the person come to the realization of the truth on their own. You have to hope the person will take a hint, because there&#39;s no forcing something like this.</p>
<p>These things can and do fail. Students often hate Shakespeare (I did &#39;til I saw &#39;Much Ado about Nothing&#39;). Friends continue to live in denial about their ex-lovers (I know I do). Sometimes communication fails. But if we don&#39;t try our best to communicate truthfully and honestly with those around us then we&#39;ve failed before we&#39;ve started.</p>

	    <p>The only way to determine whether or not<br />
anyone can be trusted is by trusting them.</p>
<p>At some point that means letting one's guard<br />
down and letting them in.</p>
<p>On the other hand, just because the invitation<br />
has been extended and the door of opportunity<br />
left open - doesn't mean there will be a rush<br />
through the entrance.</p>
<p>We can all try to be trustworthy, worthy of<br />
love, worthy of kindness, thoughtfulness,<br />
consideration.  It's not enough to try to<br />
BE the right person.  And in truth, maybe<br />
there's no such animal.</p>
<p>We can only be ourselves in the process<br />
making ourselves happy - exercising selfishness<br />
in the most self affirming way.  </p>
<p>Gandhi said, "Be the change you want to see<br />
in the world."</p>
<p>Not as much about being someone worth loving as<br />
much as loving and forgiving ourselves and granting<br />
permission to be ourselves - without apologies.</p>
<p>A fireman I once knew had on his whiteboard the<br />
comment, "If a dog could speak, we might be so<br />
surprized by the fact that we might not notice<br />
he had nothing to say."</p>
<p>We all have something to say - something worthwhile<br />
to say.</p>
<p>Our very existence grants us meaning, and purpose,<br />
and value.</p>
<p>When we understand that about ourselves, we are on<br />
the path to understanding that about others, and<br />
from that understanding comes the birth of better<br />
communication, better coexistence, ultimately a<br />
better world.</p>
<p>Mike</p>
<p>P.S. Just in case the point got lost, I liked what<br />
you had to say.  It got me thinking.</p>

<p>Are these misunderstood communications related to your VISTA work or just life in general?  I just ask because I think it might be an interesting topic for discussion...how to be UNDERSTOOD as a VISTA (versus as just a regular ol' staff or member).</p>

	    <p>The thought experiment I had in Social Psychology (or was it the Psychology of Sociology?) was:</p>
<p>If you are interacting with someone who truly dislikes you, but does a perfect job of concealing this from you, does it matter how they <em>truly</em> feel?</p>
<p>The answer was Nope.</p>
<p>People communicate to create specific external change or affect action.  In order to achieve the desired action, you must make sure that your message is received properly. In the example of Kruschev, the issue is not within the message itself, but in the communicator (Kruschev) not being aware of the language/cultural differences of his audience.  Because of this, the resulting <em>action</em> was not the intended one.</p>
<p>For effective communication, once you've identified that you have <em>something</em> you want to happen, the very first thing you must do is identify your audience (which means anything from their needs to their lifestyle to their current emotional state) and from that design your message so that the resulting action is what you intended.</p>
<p>If you think of communication as resulting in intended action, in some cases, being clear, concise or honest is not optimal.  For example, in some situations you are culturally expected to be dishonest (when negotiating you must overstate or understate your position), verbose (poetry or prose) or ambiguous (when dumping someone).</p>
<p>Of course, I do agree that many of these situations would be made easier if <em>everyone</em> was clear, concise and honest.  But if you think of this as an outcome, being clear, concise and honest in those situations might be not produce the intended action of getting <em>everyone</em> to be clear concise or honest, or even the secondary goals: getting a good deal, being published or avoiding emotional distress and physical violence.</p>
<p>Also, when working with children, or anyone really, it's not about leading them to water, it's about making them thirsty.</p>

	    <p>Based on your explanation, isn't that<br />
fundamentally about leadership?</p>
<p>Communication is also the sharing of information<br />
and nothing more.</p>
<p>If I tell you the sky is blue and that's what<br />
you hear and confirm in your reply - that's<br />
communication no more, no less, message sent,<br />
message received, message confirmed.</p>
<p>"If you are interacting with someone who truly dislikes you,<br />
but does a perfect job of concealing this from you, does it<br />
matter how they truly feel?"</p>
<p>It may matter, to you, simply because, from your premise,<br />
you don't know that they "truly dislike you" because they're<br />
doing a perfect job of concealing that from you.</p>
<p>You may think they care, when in fact they don't and you<br />
don't know that.</p>
<p>Ties in to what I said about trusting people.  One can<br />
lose sleep, time and effort looking for a litmus test<br />
for trust.  </p>
<p>Comparably, legally speaking (and perhaps socially as well),<br />
example, Miranda Rights. As long as it has been demonstrated<br />
that an individual has been read their rights using methods<br />
reasonably determined to be adequate, should they deny<br />
understanding becomes an arguable point.  Likewise, if we<br />
act in good faith in our communication, in what can<br />
reasonably be described as clear, honest and direct, from<br />
that perspective, the duplicitousness or dishonesty of the<br />
person we are speaking to is their responsibility.  Beyond<br />
that, it's a matter of to what extent their duplicitousness<br />
or dishonesty impacts our lives or goals. The more remote<br />
the impact, the less, it would seem, the necessity for care<br />
or concern.  If on the other hand, we are being held<br />
accountable for collaborative results of which they are an<br />
integral part of the potential success or failure - that's<br />
an entirely different matter.</p>
<p>If you choose not to reply, that's communication<br />
too - of a different sort.</p>
<p>"Making someone thirsty" isn't just about<br />
communication, it's about provoking action.</p>

<p>2. I don&#39;t think all communication is goal driven. I try not to be manipulative in my communications. Though certainly there is a time and place for that.</p>
<p>3. Back to Mike&#39;s comment about making the world we want. I want a world where everyone is clear, concise, and honest.  All the games and drama, I can do without.</p>
<p> 4. you are right, one needs to insight thirstiness when teaching. Any ideas?</p>

				<p><span><span>     </span></span><span>This past week has been utterly ridiculous &amp; </span><span>just unfathomable</span><span>.-lol (wait let me spell check .……..ok I&#39;m good). The premiere partnership inner city high school for The Media Aid Center just received a big grant from the desk of Arnold &quot;the Governator&quot;. This is all allocated to their arts &amp; film/media departments. The school in turn asked us to allocate the funds for them being that we&#39;re now heading those classes in their school. The scary part is that as u may know, government grants tend to expire, and so we received this news with 3 DAYS TO SPARE ! We had to crack open the catalogs and get to ordering pronto.</span><span>  All of this came just a few days after the school received another grant. How crazy is that! </span></p>
<p><span>     My boss Martin Cheesborough or Mr. C. aka Cheesy as we call him , now call me &amp; Ramon his 2 good luck charms.-lol My first month has been a blast. Hard work &amp; triumph.</span><span> </span></p>

	    <p>Hey Mike,</p>
<p>Wow, that&#39;s totally crazy and totally awesome! So glad to hear that your media program actually has funding. Would love to talk more about your organization and the classes you manage. I&#39;m working at Center for Digital Storytelling in Berkeley, also focused on media stuff, trying hard to develop our youth program.  Would love to get big $$$ from Arnold! </p>

	    <p>Hey Mike,</p>
<p>Yeah that's awesome.  Nothing like getting to buy some actual working equipment for nonprofit media projects.  You're making all the rest of VISTAs jealous ;).</p>
<p>Did your org release a formal announcement of the funding? We'd love to include it in the next Project newsletter...</p>
<p>Also, where's that video blog you/Ramon kept promising me at the PSO?</p>

				<p>Penelope Trunk, a columnist for the Boston Globe, has a very well written and insightful career planning/career coaching blog that is just outstanding (<a href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/" title="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/">http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/</a>). I only bring it up because it has helped me a great deal in putting my ongoing AmeriCorps experience in proper perspective. </p>
<p>I read it daily and I find her views on happiness, success, networking, and other topics exceptionally helpful. It makes me feel good about what Im doing, inspires me to be a better worker, and gives me hope that my hard work will pay off in the long run. Ive gotten a lot out of it, and I think y&#39;all can too. </p>
