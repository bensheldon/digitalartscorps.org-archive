				<p>Well, it's been much too long. Jules and Ben, this one is dedicated to you.</p>
<p>Since I've last checked in, this is a list of what's happened to me: </p>
<p>Positive:<br />
I created a 156 page Kennett Family Cookbook compiling recipes and family photos from my great great grandfather all the way to my youngest cousin and have shipped it to 25 members of my family.<br />
I published my soon-to-be world famous bagel recipe in said cookbook.<br />
My boyfriend and I bought our first Christmas tree, it's, how do you say... perfect in every way and undeniably gorgeous?<br />
I applied for my next year's job - hopefully another Americorps year (unfortunately the same stipend, but hey it's a really sweet job) teaching in Boston through the Boston Teacher Residency.<br />
I went on a date with Jules and Belinda and we listened to a crazy lady who refused to admit she couldn't make this really complicated chocolate frosting recipe.<br />
I joined two book clubs. </p>
<p>Negative:<br />
I missed my site's December Dinner fund raising gala on Saturday night because I had to rush home when I forgot one of my shoes and then locked my wallet and keys inside of the house. Everyone here has been working hard on it for a long time and I feel terribly.<br />
I haven't applied for Mass Health Insurance yet.</p>
<p>Even:<br />
I almost ran out of insulin a couple of weekends ago. I got some though.<br />
I bought a wine rack. But I've already spent my alcohol budget this month so it will stay barren until January. Unless my aunts and uncles come through for Christmas...<br />
Been to all of the monthly Lowell/Boston area meetings, but beyond my extensive bonding with our fearless leaders, haven't had the chance to kick it old school with the other area VISTAS...<br />
I joined the local YMCA (where all signs are in Chinese and English, or sometimes just Chinese and I have to ask)! And also joined a program that started in November called 'Maintain, Don't Gain!'. But I may or may not have gained after all that chocolate pie at Thanksgiving, and though we're supposed to be 'tightening our belt' because of the economy, there's no way I'm not putting on sweatpants after Christmas pecan pie...<br />
I had to take the GRE's. But I aced 'em.</p>
<p>I've also done a ton at work, of course, highlights which include:<br />
Attended the American Council of Teachers of Foreign Languages in Orlando, FL.<br />
Helped establish the Healthy Snacks Program<br />
Drafted the Parent and Student Handbooks<br />
Organized the Financial Aid program and presented to the room of financial aid recipients (over 120 families!) (and I was in the Chinese newspapers!!!)<br />
Coordinated the bi-lingual registration process for the fall and spring.<br />
Am currently staffing the licensing process for the school.<br />
Am working on getting more art into the school - it's so plain!<br />
Run the volunteer staff and Math/English teachers for the after school program as well as substitute teach.<br />
and stuff</p>
<p>Hope all is well with everyone, have a wonderful holiday season and I hope YOU maintain, don't gain.<br />
Actually, eat a lot. Food stamps are sweet but take it where you can get it.</p>

				<p>Well...it seems just like that my Vista life is over. My 2 years kinda flew by. I learned so much I can't even imagine where to start. Along with tons of software, I also had numerous chances to practice public speaking, attend business meetings on behalf of the company, and interact with all types of diverse &amp; fascinating people. I suppose that's what I'm most thankful for. Also, I've becoming an expert on stretching my dollar-lol </p>
<p>    A lot of my time here at The Media Aid Center has been consumed by building and updating our website mediaaidcenter.org It's a shame that I'm just now getting a handle on the whole process, but it takes twice as long when you have high school students in the room who need attention. An important rule I've learned this yr as far as programming &amp; design is "don't reinvent the wheel" ! If there's a 3rd part app or excellent tutorial on a related subject matter, use it ! I mad the mistake of approaching things as if it had never been done before &amp; I had to rely on myself.<br />
     My time here has been pretty smooth. My boss is an excellent communicator and always kept a casual and encouraging atmosphere. If money was no issue, I'd probably stay here longer.  </p>
<p>     I'll be using my two educational stipends to attend an audio school here in the LA/ Hollywood area early next year. I'll also have the time to better focus on my new hobby/website Fantastic Disaster Poetry at <a href="http://www.fdp.me" title="www.fdp.me">www.fdp.me</a> (shameless plug). I'd like to thank everyone involved in making this program work. The conferences were great, I always got paid on time, and the leaders always showed passion for what they do. </p>
<p>     Oh and to new Vistas, never make a separate Vista email folder &amp; filter to automatically sort emails. You'll forget to check it for months on in such as myself and not receive important training/conference info on time!</p>

	    <p>Hi Mike (and Ed!),<br />
Sounds like you did a great stint of service and that you're off to explore other great things for yourself.  We didn't chat with each other as much as other VISTAs, but the times we did were awesome.</p>
<p>It's inspiring to see other fellow VISTAs actively exploring what they want out of life, be it school, social change, media arts advocacy or poetry;)</p>
<p>If you want to stay  in touch with former CTC VISTAs, we have an alumni (along with current VISTA and fans of CTC VISTA) on the CTC VISTA Project Group on LinkedIn:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?about=&amp;gid=93820&amp;trk=anet_ug_grppro" title="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?about=&amp;gid=93820&amp;trk=anet_ug_grppro">http://www.linkedin.com/groups?about=&amp;gid=93820&amp;trk=anet_ug_grppro</a></p>
<p>It's a great way to stay in touch with other VISTAs, share what you are doing and stay engaged in the network.</p>
<p>Best of luck to you and do keep in touch!</p>

				<p>Hi everyone,<br />
  Well here we are at the holidays again. I have been very busy here at the Academy. The community programs I am helping to develop here are really helping people to expand there skills in an effort to work and be self sufficient. Especially great is the Ticket to work program.<br />
         I have learned so much about social security and found a lot of resources for disabled. The goal of the ticket program is to help people in the community to work or earn money and still keep SSI or SSD benefits. I help people learn academic content and pre-workforce soft skills, but also link them with real-world work experience through participation in our community service programs: Distance Learning Programs, KidTech Program, Community Computer Academy, Recycling center, Work Readiness Ticket to work program. Just to name a few. It find it really surprising the number of disabled that want to work. I can help them get around there disability and expand on their abilities which makes me feel great. Not to mention how the community feels.<br />
          I have been part of a project that provides community assistive technology and educational outreach to the community and faith based organizations that we work with. I help provide AT educational services to these organizations both on site and by remote distance learning I am managing Ticket to Work project.<br />
    I am learning myself and teaching Assistive Technology software and hardware. It’s very rewarding. I love what I do and hope I can expand my skills to become expertly proficient in them.</p>

				<p>I probably would have put this off much longer if the automated field report robot didn't start harassing me on a daily basis. Now I see you guys mean business. </p>
<p>Things are going well here in New York City. I think it goes without saying that I've been very, very busy. With what you ask? Well, I'll take it from the top. </p>
<p>In October the Digital Expansion Initiative was working hard ahead of the FCC hearing on "White Spaces." For those of you who don't know what white spaces are, you can check it out in detail <a href="http://www.peoplesproductionhouse.org/taxonomy/term/68">here</a>. But, for the short version, white spaces are the spaces between the television channels that travel through the air. In February of next year when the TV signal goes digital, these white spaces will be empty and unused. The FCC was deciding what to do with these empty spaces. Broadcasters wanted to keep the space for themselves because it's a valuable resource, but we thought it was better to allow the public to have that resource for broadband wireless through the airwaves. Fortunately for us, the FCC thought so as well. </p>
<p>To mobilize around this issue we used a wide range of grassroots strategies, partnering with local organizations here in New York and national groups in DC. There was a lot of letter writing and congressmemeber calling, but in the end the hard work paid off. </p>
<p>Since then I've been busy with trying my hand at some community radio journalism. I produce a monthly show here in NY on 99.5 FM WBAI called Global Movements Urban Struggles that features work from my trainees at the Community News Production Institute. I also report periodically for Free Speech Radio News and I'm currently working on a piece for them now. I also helped out with some election coverage for NPR which you can listen to <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96590254">here</a> .</p>
<p>Overall the work has been pretty fantastic. I've been able to get involved in a lot and I feel like I'm doing what I should be. At People's Production House, we approach media advocacy in a sort of complete way: training people to do their own radio journalism while simultaneously making sure media and Internet policies remain as open and free as possible. This approach as really given me insight to the grassroots mobilizing. We can't just complain about change or wish it to happen, we actually have to empower our communities and move them towards change and let our representatives know that change is what we want.  </p>
<p>I've been sad to learn that many of my fellow VISTAS have dropped off. I'm starting to feel guilty that I'm enjoying my site and wonder if there's something about the way the program is structured that has so many people dropping. It seems like there's very little in it for the individual to do the work we do. We get little respect and very little pay which can be tough in this recession (it's official as of today). I hope that the policy changes our new presidential candidate promises to bring in will address the hard work that VISTAS put in. He's a advocate for service and an advocate for change. I think we do both here at VISTA and I hope that we're given a little more for the time we put in. Still, I'm not complaining. I like what I do and I'm happy to do it. </p>
<p>Well, I think I've put my 250 words in for this month. Need to save them for next time. Many apologies for not keeping up with this. Till next post.</p>

	    <p>Hee hee,<br />
glad the VISTA bot is on your tail about posting (it's on mine too).</p>
<p>In regards to your community radio efforts, two things:</p>
<p>fact: radio is HUGE in native communities throughout the US (this I heard from my co-director at NAMAC - Belinda Rawlins might know a bit more about it as I know she's really into radio).  It's cheap(er), covers a broader range than some internet can and the tools have also been around longer than others (like internet, computers etc.  Radio is also relatively easy to set up to cover wide rural spaces.</p>
<p>Laura Hadden: Laura is a fellow CTC VISTA and is doing some great community radio work in conjunction with her work at CDS.  She'd be a great person to connect with to 'talk shop' if ever you needed to.  She's building a good network of peeps out here in the Bay and I know she's all about the community organizing;)</p>
<p>Anyway, that is all.  As for some of the VISTA's dropping off, VISTA is certainly not for everyone, though the low pay and (sometimes) lack of love/respect from orgs can make it difficult.  This is something we at HQ are working on constantly improving - we certainly love our VISTAs;)  </p>
<p>If you're site rocks, LIVE IT UP!  We love hearing that and certainly advocate for ALL orgs providing as much support as they can to our VISTAs.  If you do have problems, hurdles, challenges though, do talk to your VISTA Leader.</p>
<p>You're a VISTA before you're anything else.  Rock it.</p>

				<p>I have been working on updating our existing website with new content and better information architecture/navigation. Balancing the time commitment for this project has been tricky, as a completely new site is being speced out and will go into production via a third party soon – but won’t be finished until January or February. I have mapped workflows, created mockups and activity diagrams and revised site content to give users a better understanding of the organization’s mission/brand and to provide clear calls to action.</p>
<p>My other big project is creating a Marketing Plan and associated Marketing Calendar to cover the coming year, assuring that the plan incorporates metrics to measure the success of individual marketing campaigns. The new Marketing Plan outlines and defines the major target audiences and competitors for my organization. I have been performing usability reviews for the 2.0 builds and am working on a “Train the Trainer” presentation about usability testing so that everyone in our office can serve as a tester/moderator – training that will hopefully be beneficial long after my Vista tour is over. I have also been studying and reporting on the organization’s Google Analytics and Salesforce stats as well as making SEO/SEM recommendations for the new product launch in January.</p>

				<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Welcome to my first field report. I have tried posting one of these before but the browser quit and I lost everything. Dial 9- wahh wahh for the wahmbulance!</p>
<p>Anyways, my main steez here at ZUMIX is helping to keep the organization running and more specifically to work with the radio station. I help in teaching youth programs (DJ training, journalism, etc.) and overseeing its general operation. In lieu of all this I have a press package put together and I am attempting to establish some kind of sponsorship for the station. For example x company gives ZUMIX x amount of dollars and based on the amount given we then run a spot promoting x company a certain number of times throughout the course of a day. This will hopefully expand listenership of the station as well as expose those already tuning in to the company by listening to the announcement and thus increasing their business. On a bigger scale this will ideally help to build the community which could be going through a lot of changes very soon.</p>
<p>If you are not already aware, Mass Pike authority is looking to raise the toll out of East Boston (there is no toll going in) from 3.50 to 7.00 as well as jacking up the Mass Pike toll to 2.00. This is resulting from ridiculous Big Dig debt that accumulated over the course of several years. An alternative to raising these tolls is increasing the gas tax in Massachusetts. Both are being seriously considered. If the toll out of Eastie is passed the neighborhood will change substantially. This means insane traffic on the truck route in Chelsea (easiest extra 10 min way to avoid the toll) and people moving out of this neighborhood because it is becoming even more far removed from downtown than it already is (i.e. no footbridge, no public trans past 12:30am, etc.)<br />
<a href="http://www.stopthepikehike.org/" title="click here!!!!!"></a></p>
<p>A study was released over the summer with hard evidence that living closer to the airport makes you more susceptible to certain diseases (MS, cancer, etc.) This information is instilling fear into the people of East Boston making it less desirable to live in this community. I hope for the sake of this place that the toll is not increased. There is a strong community here and it would be unfortunate to see it crumble because of all this bureaucratic controlling legislation.</p>

				<p>This story takes place in Ohio. I know some of you coastal VISTAs are longing for more Ohio news and charming Midwestern commentary, like you were getting before the election. Perfect timing for me to wake from my procrastination hibernation and write my very first field report! </p>
<p>I am serving as Youth Channel Facilitator at Media Bridges <a>www.mediabridges.org</a>, a community media center that operates Cincinnati’s four public access television stations. My job is to develop a youth media program that will allow Cincinnati youth (ages 12-25) to run Media Bridges’ youth channel. The youth channel, called the Youth Block, airs youth-created programming on Media Bridges’ education channel. Part of my job is to acquire 10 hours each week of programming to be played on our Youth Block (currently we have about four hours), and to develop a plan for volunteer youth to run the Youth Block. </p>
<p>Our goal is that youth who participate in the program will learn the tools to understand how media represents youth and constructs messages which affect them. We hope that students will gain the confidence and ability to use video and radio production skills to represent themselves and get their voices out to the community. </p>
<p>My first month here I worked with the kids in our summer video and radio camp. Each class finishes with the production of a video or radio show by the kids. Right now, the summer media camp is the only established youth program at Media Bridges, and a primary source of our Youth Block programming, so I am hoping to expand on that. I’ve also been taking crash courses in all the cool technology toys we have here: I’ve learned to use a video camera, operate studio cameras, lighting and sound equipment, run a live studio show, and edit digital video. Yay!</p>
<p>The past few months have been spent researching existing youth media programs in other cities and meeting with local organizations that work with youth in order to build partnerships and get the word out about the Youth Block. In September I organized an event for One Web Day at Media Bridges (<a>http://mediabridges.org/onewebday/</a>). In October, I attended the Alliance for Community Media Central States Region conference and I also supervised a high school student who interned with me for a week as part of a senior project. In November I have been helping to revamp Media Bridges’ volunteer program to help recruit younger volunteers, and I am taking a proposal writing course online and working on writing grant proposals. </p>
<p>That’s just the basics, but stay tuned for more lively and detailed reports from the heartland as I get caught up on my field report quota. Hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving!</p>

				<p>First off, many apologies to all the VISTA gods out there, seeing as it has been many moons since I've posted a field report. In fact, the last time I reported I was working at a different place. Oops. So, fast-forward over all the messy job-changes (let's keep things positive) and suffice to say that I'm now working at Neighborhoods Partnership Network (NPN), a small non-profit in New Orleans that boasts a certain Jules Goins as a VISTA alum. Only good things can come of that, right? </p>
<p>NPN recently (a few months ago) launched a website -- <a href="http://www.npnnola.com" title="www.npnnola.com">www.npnnola.com</a> -- that allows neighborhood groups and nonprofits to share news, events, photos, info, etc, so I'm pretty much taking over publicity and outreach for that. Right now one of my projects is to get in touch with as many community organizations as possible and try to do a "web workshop" with them -- help them set up a profile and teach them how to post their news and events to the site, in hopes of increasing the site traffic and make it a more useful tool. These have been pretty good so far -- I definitely need to make a lot more phone calls and set up a lot more meetings but people are generally very enthusiastic, esp people from smaller groups who otherwise don't have a place to publicize their goings-on on the Internet. It's great to have the opportunity to meet community leaders, too.</p>
<p>I'm also responsible for producing our weekly e-newsletter -- compiling community news, events, grant info and writing a short "hot topic" about something going on in the world of New Orleans neighborhoods. We use constantcontact for this and I've found it very user friendly.</p>
<p>Other stuff: I've been writing some letters of intent and grant applications, which I really enjoy. Plus, the organization needs $$. (Who doesn't?) I've also been tracking our web traffic, newsletter readership, etc. I'm just using google analytics now which I think is more than detailed enough for our needs. Other than that, just doing general management, administrative tasks, etc, has kept me busy. </p>
<p>Hope you all enjoyed giving thanks.</p>

				<p>Howdy dowdy!<br />
Currently I am the last stages of helping out the Communications Team test email blast services. I know Vertical Response was highly recommended, but correct me if I'm wrong, I found that if an org has multiple campaigns (i.e. newsletters) and one person subscribes for all of their campaigns, and then decides to unsubscribe from one campaign, then that person is unsubscribed from all campaigns. So I have decided to check VR off of my list and check out iContact, mailChimp, and constant contact. At this point, the skill that I need to learn is HTML. That way our org doesn't have to spend on a newsletter template consultant. Guess how much that costs? ~$350 bolivares (Venezuelan currency), jk...dollars.<br />
Oh one more thing, Drupal and Joomla! may be on the backseat for a while, since our org is leaning towards redefining it's purpose etc. Which means that I will still be posting my articles relating to "community technology" but not so much trying to learn how to manage a CMS. Nevertheless, I have set a secret personal goal: to learn how to upgrade Drupal from v. 0.00001 to version 6 point something.<br />
Last time I reported, Dia de Los Muertos at Olvera Street happened and the CTCNet Conference near Inglewood happened. One challenge that I overcame was not having foodstamps for about 2 weeks. This meant that there was no more peanuts and pistachio snacking at the office, sad face. But now I am changed man!<br />
I am looking forward to eating sweet potato (aka Camote) pie (maybe one purchased from Albertsons, I will try to get one from a Farmers Market) and watching/playing football out in Mendota, Califas. Happy Turkey Day!  </p>
<p>*forgive me for the dearth of postings (thanks GRE!).</p>

	    <p>je je,<br />
a wise move to hold bac a bit on the Drupal part until your org gets their purpse redefined a bit.  They should REALLY talk with Helen De Michiel at NAMAC.  She's really been pushing this idea of a 'Digital New Deal' <a href="http://www.namac.org/node/4526" title="http://www.namac.org/node/4526">http://www.namac.org/node/4526</a></p>
<p>Remember that session at the CTCNet Conference where we went over challenges and opportunities for the CTC movement?  Many of those issues are THE SAME ISSUES that the field of media arts is facing.  We also want to align with larger policy goals to not reinvent the wheel and synergize change that is broad and deep.  Hope that's not too out there, but it was a pattern I noticed throughout the strategic planning session my org had, the sessions we had at CTCNet as well as what I see happening in the larger picture.  whoa.  anyway.</p>
<p>do you have a 'sand box' server to play around with Drupal on yet?  Maybe Josh King might be able to point you in the right direction...</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

				<p>It’s that time again.  Field REPORT!  As there have been a few developments lately I’ll share some updates with you all.  I went to my first computer distribution on November 10th in Everett, WA.  It went well but it definitely was not what I expected.  As it turned out I was the one who ended up running the distribution and “training” the recipients how to use their new computers  It seemed like some of the recipients didn’t really want to be there, or at least I was under that impression, and they just really wanted to sign for their computer and leave.  I’m not really sure how to handle that but maybe in the future we’ll have the training as a requirement before we give out the computers. I was really glad that another person from my organization, Chris Florez, was there to help out and to make sure things went smoothly.  All in all it was a successful distribution and we gave 6 families new computers.  </p>
<p>As some of you know I was at the CTCNet conference in LA.  Although it wasn’t quite what I expected in terms of a conference, it was cool to see some fellow vistas and hang out.  Also stopping in San Fran on my way back to Seattle was really sweet.  I had never been to SF and biking across the Golden Gate Bridge was probably the highlight, that or biking up Twin Peaks (I think).  After my out of state travels, I had the opportunity to travel to eastern Washington, which is really like a whole different world compared to western WA.  The landscape and the people are completely and totally different than the western side of the state.  It’s a really mountainous region and towns seem to pop up out of nowhere and are incredibly tiny.  The reason for my trip was to visit some of our TechREACH Alliance Project (TAP) clubs.  It was fun to be out on the road as I don’t have a car and drive rarely.  Belting my favorite tunes out was particularly enjoyable.  The club visits were interesting because again, like the distribution, I had envisioned the clubs using the materials we had supplied them and basically going by the book.  This was not the case with either club.  They both really focused heavily on the hands-on, which definitely isn’t a bad thing and looking back on it it’s probably true that if I were in an after school club the last thing I would want to do would be read from some student manual (even if it is awesome/informative).I was impressed with the clubs,   At least now I have an idea of how the clubs function and I’ll definitely learn more from each club I visit.  That’s all for now.  Happy T-gives.</p>

				<p>Things are going much more smoothly around here since my last post/our last small group phone conversation.  This is what is new:<br />
-we got our Facilitation Guide printed and it's super pretty and is drawing a lot of attention!<br />
-StoryLine, the web based story gathering project I'm doing has really begun to hit the ground running. We're getting calls into the skype line every week and I put them up on the website.  I've also developed a partnership for Thousand Kites with the Guild of Outsider Writers. They are an online community of writers and are volunteering to read/record the poems we get from folks in the prisons. It's great.<br />
(this is my big project, so it's exciting that it's actually going somewhere) People are starting to comment on the pieces, too, which is the goal.<br />
-I was invited to attend a convening of grantees of the Nathan Cummings Foundation in NYC last week. With about 20 other organizations my boss Nick and I spoke about Appalshop and Thousand Kites and got to share ideas. I felt fairly young and inexperienced there, but it was a fantastic learning experience and I met some wonderful people in the art/social justice field.<br />
-This weekend the gathering continued in Whitesburg when we brought 10 funders to come hang out here. It was wonderful. Yay fundraising strategies!<br />
-next up is our big Calls From Home annual holiday call in radio show, which I'm doing a ton of outreach and organizing for. </p>
<p>Super busy time right now. It finally feels really good to be here.</p>

				<p>Aspiration recently held the 2008 Nonprofit Software Development Summit in Oakland, CA which was basically a three day event to get a bunch of nonprofit techie geeks into a room, hash out the industry and then get them all drunk afterward.  It ended up going very smoothly but for those three days I was pretty stressed.  There's a lot of things to do to make an event run smoothly for 115 people.  On the up side, I learned how to navigate the Bay (SF, Berkeley and Oakland) in the car (read: mini-van) and realized how incredibly small it is.  Also, people swear at you.  But outside of picking up boxes of Aspiration T-Shirts and wildly swerving on I-80, I got to meet some really cool people doing crazy stuff in nonprofit technology.  There was this little man named Arun from India who is developing a computer program for disabled kids to use (think of Stephen Hawking's wheelchair computer) and it made me really excited about getting involved.  I also got to meet a bunch of people in the nonprofit tech industry who I interact with a lot but never actually meet because they're all over the world.  For instance, the Brattleboro Tech Collective in Vermont develops Social Source Commons and I finally got to meet Josh, the guy I talk to all the time on Skype.  It's crazy how technology totally takes down distance to nothingness.  Also, at the Summit, there were a bunch of former CTC VISTAs which was cool to find out.  They all basically felt bad for me and bought me booze which was a perk.  </p>
<p>Gunner, my boss, is going to be out of the office for the next 6 weeks which means that we're going to be working with a remote boss for a while.  It's been kind of hectic as we prepare for him not to be here for so long but it's finally easing down.  I'm vaguely worried because a lot of my tasks for my position are kind of set up so that they require Gunner's approval before they can go through.  Right now, when he's here it can take him a while to get to things, but when he's in India?  We'll see.  I mean it hasn't been a problem, it's just one of those things that you find to worry about a new situation, you know?  LAME.  </p>
<p>San Francisco "winter" is supposedly low 60s, high 50s, dreary with rain.  I think we're at the beginning of it now.  Luckily, I am told it only lasts from December through January (big contrast to the 28 months of winter we get in Michigan a year).  I think that's it for me for right now.  Later</p>

				<p>It's been a long time/ I shouldn't have left you<br />
Without a strong rhyme to step to</p>
<p>What Have I Been Working On:<br />
- Marketing: For those of you who saw the new convention banner, table covering, and booklet, I helped out on that.  From writing copy to being a contact for the banner producer, I was in the thick of it.  Also, sadly, on the cover of the booklet, along with some of my squad during the Boston scavenger hunt during PSO.</p>
<p>- Webinar: Trying to get those webinars out.  Mostly, finding presenters.  Trying to make them entertaining and informative.  If they are not, drop me a line and tell me what I can do to get them on track for you.</p>
<p>What I Learned:<br />
- Book Sprints: Thanks to the NonProfit Software Development Summit (good job Matt), I learned about book sprints, which is a way to create a book in one week through group writing and editing.  Basically, think of a retreat where you get 7 contributors together to live and work in the same space.  With one person as a "conductor", everyone works on the book and produces a printable pdf.  I'm thinking about how to use this idea for a nonprofit basics book based on the webinars.</p>

				<p>Much has happened since I started with HOME.  It's my second year working with Brighton High School and we're hard at work on the first episode of a show similar in form to English High School's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/medialab1821" title="ETV">ETV</a>.  We recently had a screening of the TV show produced during our summer intensive program called Teen TV over at EHS.  The three episodes from this summer can be viewed at <a href="http://teentvboston.blip.tv" title="http://teentvboston.blip.tv">http://teentvboston.blip.tv</a>.  Teen TV mostly highlights local organization doing positive work in the community and with teens.  </p>
<p>We've added Somerville High School to the list of school we work with, so I'm doing whatever I can to support our new lab coordinator.  Craig has been teaching a video production class as well as collaborating on video projects with other classes, including a Spanish class and a music composition class.  He's also been using a <a href="http://www.homeinc.org/somerville/" title="Drupal website">Drupal website</a> I developed for the school which allows him and his class to post assignments and projects and interact with one another.  Over the coming months I will be continuing to develop our Drupal websites, organize our resources online and put in place an infrastructure that will support our expanding programs.</p>
<p>This is my second year, and I don't believe I've posted a field report before, so here's a rundown of what went down last year with some clips for anyone who's interested.  Last school year I split my time between Brighton High School and Social Justice Academy, mostly keeping our program afloat but also expanding it at the schools to cover multiple disciplines.  Some notable projects at Brighton High School included a series of videos with a history class based on some landmark Supreme Court decisions and a weekly program with a group of students with behavior problems where we held discussions about making choices, which were videotaped by the students.  The after school media program also taped and edited school events with multiple cameras such as the Senior fashion show and the school musical Little Shop of Horrors.</p>
<p>At Social Justice Academy my associate and I did a documentary project with a group of students exploring the presidential primary race and what it means to have two minority candidates with a legitimate shot at the highest office in the land.  The project was not entirely successful, as I expected both the students and their teachers to take more initiative and have some student involvement in the editing process, but it did get them doing some research, thinking and talking about the subject.<br />

<p>We also got involved with a project called The Peer Justice System, an alternative disciplinary system being pioneered at the school based on principals of restorative justice.  A group of students from the law and justice class met weekly with a group of Northeastern University law students to learn about legal issues and restorative justice, and eventually hold a series of Youth Courts where the responsible party(s) would be given a remedy by a jury of their peers, with students advocating for the responsible parties, the school community and presiding over the court.  We documented several of their meeting from which a video was produced, as well as helped students record the two Youth Courts that were held.<br />

				<p>In reference to the projects I am working on;<br />
I am currently working in the refurbishing program, this involves refurbishing Pentium 4 computer we get from G.S.A. and other sources, we then have bi weekly classes on the fundamentals of computer operations which is a 2 hour class given on Saturday’s. At the end of the class we give the participants a fully functional computer, mouse, keyboard, and flat screen monitor. I have a word class that is taught on Wednesday’s of every week, I have to teach this class because the individual that was doing it found employment. Wildtech is also gearing up for a visit from the Microsoft foundation to be held here on December 1st or 2nd. So, there is need for a presentation to be given in reference to what we do here. At this moment I am getting together the necessary information to give a PowerPoint presentation on what we do. My responsibilities do vary; one other thing I have accomplished is to set up a chapter of Wilderness Technology Alliance here at CCNV, where we have a voting board of which I was voted the President. We have by laws and the whole nine yards. My idea is to train as many people from the shelter as possible in the Microsoft Office programs to help them reenter society as productive individuals. I figure, since this is the capital there should be a lot of jobs individuals living here can qualify for.</p>

				<p>The Suffrage Centennial Workshop, teacher professional development on the subject of Women's Suffrage in Washington State, has been my primary focus for the past six months. Coming up December 6th our third seminar will be held focusing on the contradictory methods used by the two sides of Washington State to win suffrage. The SCW is funded by a grant from National Endowment for the Humanities and is classified as a We the People Project. I am currently serving as Project Director on this grant and has been a wonderful learning experience. The SCW is composed of 6 seminars over 18 months with 5 humanities scholars from area universities. We have 20 teachers participating from elementary to high school teachers. You never realize how much planning and work goes into a workshop until you have to do the work. </p>
<p>In addition to this I've been doing grants research for my organization. Since it is the nature of the beast and is necessary for us to keep running. I'm also learning how to write grants and with a mentor that has a very high return on grant success it has been extremely beneficial. </p>
<p>Over the summer we finished our documentary on small town museums. This is available online at <a href="http://history.tincan.org" title="http://history.tincan.org">http://history.tincan.org</a>. So check it out if you have time. </p>
<p>When I say we I mean that I've worked with other members of my organization to make these projects happen. After attending the CTCNet conference this month I realized that I am extremely luckily. I have a wonderful organization that I work for, that has never made any kind of distinction between my status as a Vista and as an employee of the organization. And when my service ends in 2 months I will become a full time employee for Tincan. I feel that I have accomplished my goals as a Vista since I've been able to assist in securing funds to make Inland Northwest Memories Project sustainable. </p>
<p>This has been an unimaginable opportunity for me and even though I've made several sacrifices to make these past two years possible it has been well worth it.</p>

				<p>My Field report.  This is where I describe the work that i am continually doing, and help other VISTA's understand their role?  ok.     Well it seems that when i had first gotten here there was a different role that i was supposed to play, sort of, besides the one that i had taken upon myself. So it took a little bit for everything to get understood and for everyone to be on the same page. My organization has been around for almost thirteen years i think so i feel everyone here is pretty good at making it look like everything is going smoothly, but, considering we have a new exec. Direc.  Everything is not so smooth, well it is smooth don't take this too literal but there is some minor inter employee bickering, stuff like that. overall it is rather annoying, but other than that i am experiencing one of the greatest things i have ever done, teaching. Young children, to the elderly. I am finding who learns faster and who stands there with their eyes and ears closed, let alone mouth.   I have taught Catholic school children field production and Louse Buddhist Monks Final Cut Pro on their first i mac.  To tell you the truth i am good friends with the monks and enjoy their company, they have meditation and Saturdays and Wednesdays and yoga on the same days.  I feel my role as a Vista is different somewhat due to the fact that i am serving somewhere where i had been interning for about a year and was a member myself for about a year,<br />
So most of the members had already known my name, but now people are starting to rely on me, I am the wiz kid.    I am aso serving in the same city as three other vistas from the 119 Gallery which is one of my fav. places, and utec-united teen equality center and i work with both, and that work is great.  to be continued...</p>

				<p>Most of my day is spent working on projects to boost our numbers of students and mentors (i.e. recruitment.) Now that it’s getting near the holidays, this has slowed down. When I first started here, it felt like I had a least one or two events a week I attended in order to round up more students or volunteers. Thankfully, those days have ended. We actually have an organization in my town whose purpose is to coordinate after-school youth programs. They were a great help to me when I first started because they compiled a list of a number of different events where youth could be reached (community events, back-to-school, nights, etc.) Unfortunately, they don’t have enough funding to continue everything they have been doing this summer but hopefully they will be able to find it somewhere. </p>
<p>I’m glad that recruitment has slowed down because it gives me time to plan for next year. Also, as a side project, I’ve been working on a portion of our website. I wanted to create a list of all the different programs we have along with tutorials and example projects. Many of our mentors come in knowing Office but not much beyond that (myself included when I started as a mentor.) Therefore, we’re trying to beef up our training for them so that they feel more comfortable when kids ask “How do I make a game?” or “How can I create this in Fireworks?” Rather than looking like a deer in the headlights, we’d like them to feel comfortable saying “Well, let’s start here.” The site is certainly still a work in progress but if you want to check it out, you can find it <a href="http://www.computers4kids.net/mentors/project_examples.htm">here</a>.  I’d be glad to have any feedback, tutorials, or additional free programs you might suggest. Also, if you work with kids and are looking for anything (Nathan, you were asking me about this at one point), then you may want to check out some of the free programs available. My favorite is GIMP since it does much the same as Photoshop but has a much better price tag (free!) but Alice is also a pretty unusual program when it decides to work correctly. </p>
<p>P.S. Why is it so cold in Virginia? I wish it were April...</p>

	    <p>Thanks Davina!  It's also unseasonably freezing cold in North Carolina as well.  Let's find a nonprofit conference in Miami or something -- have you discovered (or attended) one of those yet?  Maybe there will be a cheap tech summit on a cruise ship in the Caribbean... that'd be ideal!</p>

	    <p>I haven't discovered/attended any though it's be amazing to see some palm trees AND call it work. Why don't we just move down that way after AmeriCorps instead? I doubt it gets to 20 degrees there in November...</p>
